The Royal Academy of Sciences calls for a survey of the advances in one
20: 259
part of philosophy, in one part of academic Europe, and also during one
part of the present century.
That seems to be a readily performable task, for it only has to do
with history, and since the advances in astronomy and chemistry, qua
empirical sciences, have already found their historians, while those in
mathematical analysis or pure mechanics, achieved in the same country
and period, will soon find theirs, too, if wanted, there seems to be equally
little difficulty with the science here in question.
But this science is metaphysics, and that completely alters the situation. This is a shoreless sea, in which progress leaves no trace behind,
and whose horizon contains no visible goal by which one might perceive
how nearly it has been approached. In regard to this science, which itself
has almost always existed in idea only, the prescribed task is very difficult,
the very possibility of resolving it a thing to be almost despaired of, and
even should it succeed, the condition laid down, of presenting in brief
compass the advances it has achieved, makes the difficulty greater still.
For metaphysics is by nature and intention a completed whole; either
nothing or everything. So what is required for its final purpose cannot be
dealt with in a fragmentary way, as in mathematics or empirical natural
science, where progress is constant and unending. But we shall attempt
the task nonetheless.
The first and most necessary question is doubtless this: What does
reason actually want with metaphysics? What purpose does it have in
view in treating of the subject? For that end is the great, perhaps the
greatest, indeed the one and only purpose which reason can ever look to
in its speculation, since all men are more or less engaged in it, and since
there is no understanding why, given the ever-apparent futility of their
efforts in this field, it would still be in vain to tell them that they should
at last give up rolling this stone of Sisyphus,1 were not the interest that 20: 260
reason takes in the subject the most ardent that can be entertained.
This ultimate purpose, to which the whole of metaphysics is directed,
is easy to discover, and can in this respect found a definition of the subject:
“It is the science of progressing by reason from knowledge of the sensible
to that of the super-sensible.”
But within the sensible2 we include that whose representation is
considered in relation, not merely to the senses, but also to the
353What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
understanding, so long as the pure concepts of the latter are thought
in their application to objects of the senses, and thus for purposes of a
possible experience; thus the nonsensory, such as the concept of cause,
which has its seat and origin in the understanding, can still, as regards
knowledge of an object by means of it, be said to belong to the field of
the sensory, that is, to objects of the senses.
Ontology3 is that science (as part of metaphysics) which consists in
a system of all concepts of the understanding, and principles, but only
so far as they refer to objects that can be given to the senses, and thus
confirmed by experience. It makes no allusion to the super-sensible,
which is nevertheless the final aim of metaphysics, and thus belongs to the
latter only as a propaedeutic, as the hallway or vestibule of metaphysics
proper, and is called transcendental philosophy, because it contains the
conditions and first elements of all our knowledge a priori.
In this field there has not been much progress since the days of
Aristotle. For as grammar is the resolution of a speech-form into its
elementary rules, and logic a resolution of the form of thought, so ontology is a resolution of knowledge into the concepts that lie a priori
in the understanding, and have their use in experience; a system whose
troublesome elaboration we may very well be spared, if only we bear
in mind the rules for the right use of these concepts and principles, for
purposes of empirical knowledge; for experience always confirms or corrects it, which does not happen if our design is to progress from the
sensible to the super-sensible, for which purpose an assessment of the
powers of understanding and its principles must indeed be carried out
with thoroughness and care, in order to know from whence, and with
what props and crutches, reason can venture upon its transition from the
objects of experience to those that are not of this kind.
20: 261 Now the celebrated Wolf has rendered an incontestable service to
ontology, by his clarity and precision in analysing these powers; but not
by any addition to our knowledge in that area, since the subject matter
was exhausted.
However, the above definition, which merely indicates what is wanted
of metaphysics, not what there needs to be done in it, would simply
mark it out from other doctrines as a discipline belonging to philosophy
in the specific meaning of the term, i.e., to the doctrine of wisdom,4 and
prescribe its principles to the absolutely necessary practical use of reason;
though that has only an indirect relation to metaphysics considered as
a scholastic science and system of certain theoretical cognitions a priori,
which are made the immediate topic of concern. Hence the explanation
of metaphysics according to the notion of the schools will be that it
is the system of all principles of purely theoretical rational knowledge
through concepts; or in brief, that it is the system of pure theoretical
philosophy.
354What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
It therefore contains no practical doctrines of pure reason, though it
does contain the theoretical doctrines which underlie their possibility.
It contains no mathematical propositions, i.e., such as produce rational
knowledge through the construction of concepts, but does contain the
principles of the possibility of a mathematics as such. By reason in this
definition we are, moreover, to understand only the capacity for knowledge a priori, i.e., knowledge which is not empirical.
Now to have a yardstick for what has lately been happening in metaphysics, we must compare it to what has been done in the subject of old,
and both to what ought to have been done there. But we shall be able
to reckon in as a part of the progress, i.e., as a negative advance, the
conscious and deliberate recurrence to maxims of the mode of thought,
since even if it were only the removal of a deep-seated error, spreading
far and wide in its consequences, something can still be done thereby
for the benefit of metaphysics; just as a person who has strayed from
the right path, and returns to his starting point in order to pick up his
compass, is at least commended because he did not go on wandering up
the wrong road, or come to a halt, but reverted to his point of departure
in order to orient himself.
The first and oldest steps in metaphysics were not ventured merely 20: 262
as risky attempts, say, but were made, rather, with complete confidence,
though without having first initiated any careful inquiries as to the possibility of a priori cognitions. What was the cause of this trust that reason
had in itself? Its imagined success. For in mathematics reason succeeded
in knowing a priori the constitution of things, well beyond all expectation of the philosophers; why should there not be just as much success in
philosophy?5 As to the possibility of knowledge a priori, it did not strike
the metaphysicians as a radical difference, to be treated as an important
problem, that mathematics proceeds on the terrain of the sensory, since
reason itself can construct concepts for it, i.e., present them a priori in
intuition, and thus know the objects a priori, whereas philosophy undertakes an extension of reason’s knowledge by mere concepts, where its
objects cannot, as in the other case, be set before us, since they hover, as it
were, ahead of us in the air. It was enough to extend a priori knowledge,
even outside mathematics, by mere concepts, and that this extension
contains truth is evidenced by the agreement of such judgments and
principles with experience.
Now although the super-sensible, to which the aim of reason is directed in metaphysics, actually provides no basis whatever for theoretical
knowledge, the metaphysicians still sallied confidently forth under the
guidance of their ontological principles, which are admittedly a priori
in origin, but valid only for objects of experience; and although the
imagined yield of transcendent insights upon the road could be confirmed by no experience, it could also, precisely because it relates to the
355What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
super-sensible, be refuted by no experience either; it was necessary only
to beware of letting any self-contradiction intrude into one’s judgments,
which can perfectly well be done, even though these judgments, and the
concepts underlying them, may otherwise be completely empty.
This path of the dogmatists, which dates back to an age still earlier
than that of Plato and Aristotle, and reaches forward to include even
that of a Leibniz and Wolf, is, if assuredly not the right path, at least the
most natural one to the goal of reason, and to the delusive conviction
that everything which reason undertakes on the analogy of its procedure
when successful, must equally be bound to succeed.
The second and almost equally ancient move made by metaphysics
20: 263 was, on the other hand, a regression, which would have been wise and
profitable to the subject, if only it had extended back to the starting point
of the venture, though not to halt there with the resolve of attempting no
further advance, but rather with that of resuming it in a new direction.
This regression, putting an end to all further initiatives, was based
on the total failure of all attempts in metaphysics. But how could this
failure, and the shipwreck of its grand enterprises, be recognized? Is
it experience, perchance, that refuted them? By no means. For what
reason proclaims to be the extension a priori of its knowledge of the
objects of possible experience, in mathematics and ontology alike, are
real steps, proceeding in a forward direction, and by which it assuredly
gains ground. No, it is with intended and imagined conquests in the
field of the super-sensible, where it is a question of the absolute totality
of Nature, which no sense apprehends, and likewise of God, Freedom
and Immortality; it is there, and chiefly in connection with the latter
three objects, in which reason takes a practical interest, that all attempts
at extension now miscarry; a thing seen, however, not because a deeper
knowledge of the super-sensible, a higher metaphysics, teaches us the
opposite of those earlier opinions; for we cannot compare the one with
the other, since as transcendent objects they are unknown to us. It is
because there are principles in our reason whereby, to every proposition
that would extend our knowledge of such objects, a seemingly no less
authentic counter-proposition is opposed, so that reason itself destroys
its own attempts.6
This path of the skeptic is naturally of somewhat later origin, though
still old enough, and it continues at the same time to persist in very
good minds everywhere, albeit that another interest than that of pure
reason constrains many to conceal the impotence of reason in this matter. The extension of skepticism even to the principles of knowledge of
the sensible, and to experience itself, cannot properly be considered a
serious view that has been current in any period of philosophy, but has
perhaps been a challenge to the dogmatists, to demonstrate those a priori
principles on which the very possibility of experience depends; and since
356What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
they could not do this, a way of presenting those principles to them as
doubtful too.
The third and most recent step that metaphysics has taken, by which
its fate must be decided, is the critique of pure reason itself, in regard to 20: 264
its power of effecting an a priori extension of human knowledge generally,
whether it be concerned with the sensible or the super-sensible. If this
critique has performed what it promises, namely to determine the scope,
the content, and the bounds of such knowledge – if it has done this in
Germany, and done it since the days of Leibniz and Wolf – then the
problem of the Royal Academy of Sciences will have been resolved.
There are therefore three stages which philosophy had to traverse
in its approach to metaphysics. The first was the stage of dogmatism;
the second that of skepticism; and the third that of the criticism of pure
reason.7
This temporal sequence is founded in the nature of man’s cognitive capacity. Once the first two stages have been passed, the state of
metaphysics can continue to vacillate for many centuries, leaping from
an unlimited self-confidence of reason to boundless mistrust, and back
again. But a critique of its own powers would put it into a condition
of stability, both external and internal, in which it would need neither
increase nor decrease, nor even be capable of this.
357Treatise
20:265 The solution of the problem in hand can be divided into two sections,
of which one deals with the formal in reason’s procedure for creating
metaphysics as a theoretical science, while the other derives from that
procedure the material – the final aim that reason has in view with metaphysics, whether that aim be achieved or not.
The first part will therefore present merely the steps towards metaphysics that have lately been taken; the second, the advances of metaphysics itself in the field of pure reason. The first contains the current state of transcendental philosophy, the second that of metaphysics
proper.
FIRST SECTION
History of Transcendental Philosophy
among Us in Recent Times
The first step to have been undertaken in this investigation of reason
is the distinction of analytic from synthetic judgments generally.8 Had
this been clearly recognized in the days of Leibniz or Wolf, we should
somewhere find such a distinction not only touched upon, in a Logic or
Metaphysics that has since appeared, but also emphasized as important.
For the first type of judgment is invariably a priori, and coupled with the
consciousness of its necessity. The second can be empirical, and logic is
unable to furnish the condition under which a synthetic a priori judgment
would occur.
20: 266 The second step is simply to have posed the question: How are synthetic a priori judgments possible? For that there are such judgments is
proved by numerous examples from the general theory of Nature, but
especially from pure mathematics. Hume has already performed a service in pointing out a case, namely that of the law of causality, whereby
he put all metaphysicians into a quandary.9 What would have happened
if he, or someone else, had propounded the question in general! The
whole of metaphysics would have had to remain in abeyance until it had
been resolved.
The third step is the problem: “How is an a priori knowledge possible from synthetic judgments?” Knowledge is a judgment from which
proceeds a concept that has objective reality, i.e., to which a corresponding object can be given in experience. But all experience consists in the
358What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
intuition of an object, i.e., an immediate and individual representation,
through which the object is given as to knowledge, and a concept, i.e.,
a mediate representation through a characteristic common to many objects, whereby it is therefore thought. Neither of the two types of representation constitutes knowledge on its own, and if there are to be
synthetic a priori cognitions, there must also be a priori intuitions as well
as concepts, whose possibility must therefore first be discussed, and then
their objective reality proved through the necessary use of them, in virtue
of the possibility of experience.
An intuition that is to be possible a priori can only relate to the form
under which the object is intuited, for that means to represent something
a priori to oneself, to make a representation of it to oneself prior to
perception, i.e., prior to and independent of empirical consciousness.
But the empirical in perception, the sensation or impression (impressio),
is the matter of intuition, in which therefore the intuition would not be
an a priori representation. Such an intuition, therefore, as relates merely
to form, is called pure intuition, which if it is to be possible must be
independent of experience.10
But it is not the form of the object, as it is in itself, which makes
intuition a priori possible, but rather that of the subject, namely the form
of sense, of that kind of representation which he, the subject, is capable
of. For if this form were to be taken from the object itself, we would first
have to perceive this, and could become aware of its nature only in this
perception. But that would then be an empirical intuition a priori. But
whether it be the latter or not is something of which we can persuade
ourselves, as soon as we attend to whether the judgment which attributes 20: 267
this form to the object carries necessity with it, or not; for in the latter
case it is merely empirical.
The form of the object, as it can alone be represented in an intuition
a priori, is therefore based, not upon the constitution of this object in
itself, but on the natural constitution of the subject who is capable of an
intuitive representation of the object; and this subjective in the formal
constitution of sense, as receptivity for the intuition of an object, is the
only thing which makes possible a priori, i.e., in advance of all perception,
an a priori intuition; and now both this, and the possibility of synthetic
a priori judgments from the standpoint of intuition, can be quite well
understood.
For one can know a priori how and in what form the objects of sense
will be intuited, namely as is entailed by the subjective form of sensibility,
i.e., the receptivity of the subject for the intuition of those objects; and
strictly speaking, one should really not say that the form of the object
is represented by us in pure intuition, but rather that it is a merely
formal and subjective condition of sensibility, under which we intuit
given objects a priori.
359What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
This, therefore, is the peculiar constitution of our (human) intuition, so far as the representation of objects is possible to us merely
as sensory beings. We might certainly imagine for ourselves an immediate (direct) way of representing an object, which does not intuit objects according to conditions of sensibility, and so does it by way of the
understanding. But we have no tenable concept of such an intuition,
though we need to think of it, in order not to subject all beings that
have powers of cognition to our own form of intuition. For it may be
that some beings in the world might intuit the same objects under another form; and even if this form should be just the same, and necessarily
so, in all such beings, we still have no more insight into this necessity
than we do into the possibility of a supreme understanding, free, in his
knowledge, from all sensibility, and at the same time from the need to
know by concepts, who knows objects perfectly in mere (intellectual)
intuition.11
Now the critique of pure reason proves, of the representations of
space and time, that they are pure intuitions such as we have just insisted
20: 268 that they must be, in order to lie a priori at the basis of all our knowledge
of things, and I can confidently appeal to that proof, without having to
trouble about objections.
I would only note further, that in regard to inner sense, the doubled
self in consciousness of myself, namely that of inner sensory intuition,
and that of the thinking subject, seems to many to presuppose two subjects in one person.
This, then, is the theory, that space and time are nothing but subjective
forms of our sensory intuition, and in no way determinations appertaining to objects in themselves; but that precisely for this reason we are able
to determine these intuitions of ours a priori, with consciousness of the
necessity of the judgments in which we determine them, as in geometry,
for example. But to determine is to judge synthetically.
This theory can be called the doctrine of the ideality of space and
time,12 since the latter come to be represented as something in no way
dependent on things in themselves; a doctrine that is not just a mere
hypothesis, so as to be able to explain the possibility of synthetic a priori
knowledge, but a demonstrated truth, since it is absolutely impossible to
extend one’s knowledge beyond the given concept without founding it
on some intuition, and if this extension is to be a a priori, on an a priori
intuition; and an a priori intuition is likewise impossible without seeking
it in the formal constitution of the subject, not in that of the object;
because on the former assumption all objects of sense are presented in
intuition according to that formal constitution, and thus must be known
a priori and as necessary according to it; whereas if the latter assumption
360What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
were to be made, synthetic a priori judgments would be empirical and
contingent, which is a contradiction.
This ideality of space and time is nevertheless, at the same time, a
doctrine of their perfect reality in regard to objects of the senses (outer
and inner) qua appearances, i.e., as intuitions so far as their form depends
on the subjective constitution of the senses; the knowledge of which,
since it is founded on a priori principles of pure intuition, permits a
certain and demonstrable science; whereas those subjective factors which
concern the constitution of sense-intuition in regard to its matter, namely
sensation, e.g., of bodies in light as color, in sound as tones, or in taste
as sour, etc., remain merely subjective, and can provide no knowledge 20: 269
of the object, and thus no generally valid representation in empirical
intuition; nor can they yield any example of such, in that they do not,
like space and time, contain data for a priori cognitions, and cannot even
be counted as knowledge of objects at all.
It should further be noted that appearance, taken in the transcendental
sense, where we say of things that they are appearances ( phaenomena),
is a concept quite different in meaning from that whereby I say that
this thing appears to me this way or that, which is meant to indicate
the physical appearance, and can be called apparency, or seeming.13 For
in the language of experience these are objects of the senses, because
I can compare them only with other sensible objects; for example, the
heaven with all its stars, though it actually be mere appearance, can
be considered as a thing-in-itself; and if it is said of this that it has
the look of a vault, the semblance here signifies the subjective in the
presentation of a thing, which may result in falsely taking it in a judgment
for objective.
And thus the proposition that all presentations of the senses acquaint
us only with objects as appearances is in no way equivalent to the judgment that they contain only the semblance of objects, as the idealist would
maintain.14
But in the theory of all objects of sense as mere appearances, there is
nothing that creates a stranger impression than that I, regarded as the
object of inner sense, i.e., as soul, can be known to myself as appearance merely, not according to that which I am as thing-in-itself; and
yet the representation of time, as mere formal inner intuition a priori,
which underlies all knowledge of myself, permits no other way of explaining the possibility of acknowledging that form as condition of selfconsciousness.
The subjective in the form of sensibility, which is the a priori basis
of all intuition of objects, made it possible for us to have a knowledge
a priori of objects as they appear to us. We shall now define this term
more accurately, in that we declare this subjective to be the mode of
representation whereby our senses are affected by objects, from without
361What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
or within (i.e., from ourselves), so as to be able to say that we know these
objects only as appearances.
20: 270 That I am conscious of myself is a thought that already contains a
twofold self, the self as subject and the self as object. How it should be
possible that I, who think, can be an object (of intuition) to myself, and
thus distinguish myself from myself, is absolutely impossible to explain,
although it is an undoubted fact; it demonstrates, however, a power so
far superior to all sensory intuition, that as ground of the possibility of
an understanding it has as its consequence a total separation from the
beasts, to whom we have no reason to attribute the power to say ‘I’ to
oneself, and looks out upon an infinity of self-made representations and
concepts. We are not, however, referring thereby to a dual personality;
only the self that thinks and intuits is the person, whereas the self of the
object that is intuited by me is, like other objects outside me, the thing.
Of the self in the first sense (the subject of apperception), the logical
self as a priori representation, it is absolutely impossible to know anything
further as to what sort of being it is, or what its natural constitution may
be; it is like the substantial, which remains behind after I have taken away
all the accidents that inhere in it, but absolutely cannot be known any
further at all, since the accidents were precisely that whereby I was able
to know its nature.
But the self in the second sense (as subject of perception), the psychological self as empirical consciousness, is capable of being known in
many ways, among which time, the form of inner intuition, is that which
underlies a priori all perceptions and their combination whose apprehension (apprehensio) conforms to the manner in which the subject is thereby
affected, i.e., to the condition of time, in that the sensory self is determined by the intellectual to take up this condition into consciousness.15
That this is so, every inner psychological observation that we undertake can serve us as proof and example; since for this we are required
to affect the inner sense, in part also doubtless to the point of fatigue,
by means of attention (for thoughts, as factual determinations of the
power of representation, also belong to the empirical representation of
our state), in order to have first of all in the intuition of ourself a knowledge of what inner sense is presenting to us; which then merely makes us
aware of ourself as we appear to ourselves; whereas the logical self does
20: 271 indeed point to the subject as it is in itself, in pure consciousness, not as
receptivity but as pure spontaneity, but beyond that is also incapable of
knowing anything of its nature.
Of a priori Concepts
Once the subjective form of sensibility is applied, as it must be if its
objects are to be taken as appearances, to objects as the forms thereof,
362What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
it brings about in its determination a representation inseparable from
this, namely that of the composite.16 For we can represent a determinate
space to ourselves no otherwise than by drawing it, i.e., by adding one
space to the other, and so also with time.
Now the representation of a composite, as such, is not a mere intuition, but requires the concept of a compounding, so far as it is applied
to the intuition in space and time. So this concept (along with that of its
opposite, the simple) is one that is not abstracted from intuitions, as a
part-representation contained in them, but is a basic concept, and a priori
at that – in the end the sole basic concept a priori, which is the original
foundation in the understanding for all concepts of sensible objects.
There will thus be as many a priori concepts resident in the understanding, to which objects given to the senses must be subordinated, as
there are types of compounding (synthesis) with consciousness, i.e., as
there are types of synthetic unity of apperception of the manifold given
in intuition.
Now these concepts are the pure concepts of the understanding for
all objects that might be presented to our senses; set forth by Aristotle
under the name of categories, albeit mingled with alien concepts, and
by the Scholastics under that of predicaments, with exactly the same
errors, these concepts could well have been drawn up into a systematically
ordered table, if what logic has to teach concerning the formal diversity
of judgments had previously been put into the framework of a system.
The understanding shows its power solely in judgments, which are
nothing else but the unity of consciousness in relation to concepts as such,
regardless of whether that unity is analytic or synthetic. Now the pure
concepts of understanding, of objects as such that are given in intuition, 20: 272
are the very same logical functions, but only insofar as they present a
priori the synthetic unity of the apperception of the manifold that is
given in an intuition as such; thus the table of categories, parallel to that
of the logical functions, could be outlined completely, though this had
not been done prior to the publication of the Critique of Pure Reason.17
It should be noted, however, that these categories, or predicaments
(as they are otherwise called), presuppose no particular kind of intuition
which (like that which alone is possible to us men) is sensory as space and
time are; they are merely thought-forms for the concept of an object of
intuition as such, of whatever kind that may be, and even if it were a supersensible intuition, of which we are unable to frame any specific concept.
For we must always frame to ourselves through pure understanding a
concept of an object of which we wish to judge something a priori, even
though we subsequently find it to be transcendent, and such that no
objective reality can be procured for it; so that the category per se does
not depend upon the forms of sensibility, space and time, but may also
be based upon other forms quite unthinkable to us, so long as they relate
363What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
only to the subjective which is antecedent a priori to all knowledge, and
makes synthetic a priori judgments possible.
Among the categories, as original concepts of the understanding, are
included also the predicables, as a priori concepts either of pure understanding, or sensorily conditioned, which arise from such compounding,
and are thus derivative; the first of them yields existence considered as
magnitude, i.e., duration, or change, as existence with opposite determinations; the second, the concept of motion, as change of position in
space – examples which could likewise be completely enumerated and
systematically presented in a table.
Transcendental philosophy, i.e., the doctrine of the possibility of all
a priori knowledge as such, which is that critique of pure reason whose
elements have now been completely set forth, has as its purpose the
founding of a metaphysic, whose purpose in turn envisages as an aim of
20: 273 pure reason the extension of the latter from the limits of the sensible
to the field of the super-sensible; a transit which, if it is not to be a
dangerous leap,18 seeing that it is not, after all, a continuous progression
in the same order of principles, makes necessary a scrupulous attention
to the bounds of both domains, which obstructs progress.
From thence follows the division of the stages of pure reason, into
doctrine of science, as a sure advance; doctrine of doubt, as a haltingpoint; and doctrine of wisdom, as a transition to the ultimate purpose
of metaphysics: so that the first will contain a theoretico-dogmatic doctrine, the second a skeptical discipline, and the third a practico-dogmatic
creed.
FIRST SECTION
Of the Scope of the Theoretico-Dogmatic
Use of Pure Reason
The content of this section is the proposition: The scope of the theoretical knowledge of pure reason extends no further than to objects of the
senses.
In this proposition, as an exponible judgment, two others are contained:
(1) that reason, as a power of knowing things a priori, extends to objects
of the senses;
(2) that in its theoretical use it can certainly produce the concepts, but
never a theoretical knowledge, of that which cannot be an object
of the senses.
364What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
For proof of the first proposition it is also proper to consider how
an a priori knowledge of sensible objects may be possible, since without
that we would not be quite sure whether judgments about those objects
were also in fact cognitions; but as to their nature, in being a priori
judgments, it is automatically evinced through the consciousness of their
necessity.
For a representation to be a cognition (though here I mean always
a theoretical one), we need to have concept and intuition of an object
combined in the same representation, so that the former is represented
as containing the latter under itself. Now if a concept is one drawn from 20: 274
the sensory representation, i.e., an empirical concept, it contains as a
characteristic, i.e., as a part-representation, something that was already
apprehended in the sensory intuition, and differs from the latter in logical
form only, viz., in respect of its generality, e.g., the concept of a fourfooted animal in the representation of a horse.
But if the concept is a category, a pure concept of the understanding, it
lies entirely outside all intuition, and yet an intuition must be subsumed
under it if it is to be used for knowledge; and if this knowledge is to
be an a priori cognition, a pure intuition must be underlaid, and one
which conforms to the synthetic unity of apperception of the manifold
in the intuition which is being thought through the category; i.e., the
power of representation must interpose beneath the pure concept of
the understanding an a priori schema,19 without which it could have no
object at all, and thus serve for no cognition.
Now since all the knowledge of which man is capable is sensory,
and the a priori intuition of it space and time, and since both present
objects only as objects of the senses, not as things proper, our theoretical
knowledge as such, even if it be knowledge a priori, is still confined
to objects of the senses, and within these confines can certainly proceed
dogmatically, by laws that it prescribes a priori to Nature, as the collective
body of sense objects; but can never get out beyond this circle, in order
to extend itself, still theoretically, by means of its concepts.
The knowledge of sense objects as such, i.e., through empirical representations of which we are conscious (through combined perceptions),
is experience.20 Hence our theoretical knowledge never transcends the
field of experience. Now since all theoretical knowledge must accord
with experience, this will be possible only in one of two ways, in that
either experience is the ground of our knowledge, or knowledge the
ground of experience. So if there is a synthetic knowledge a priori, then
the only way out is that it must contain conditions a priori of the possibility of experience as such. But in that case it also contains the conditions
of the possibility of the objects of experience as such, since only through
experience can they be knowable objects for us. But the a priori principles 20: 275
365What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
by which alone experience is possible are the forms of the objects, space
and time, and the categories, which contain a priori the synthetic unity
of consciousness, so far as empirical representations can be subsumed
under it.
The supreme problem of transcendental philosophy is therefore: How
is experience possible?
The basic principle, that all knowledge begins solely from experience, involves a quaestio facti,a and is thus not at issue here, since the fact
is unreservedly granted. But whether it is also to be derived solely from
experience, as the supreme ground of knowledge, is a quaestio juris, an
affirmative answer to which would inaugurate the empiricism of transcendental philosophy, and a negative one the rationalism of the same.
The first is a self-contradiction; for if all knowledge is of empirical
origin, then regardless of what may be grounded a priori in the understanding, and can ever be admitted, by the law of contradiction, to
reflection and its logical principle, the synthetic in knowledge, which
constitutes the essence of experience, is still purely empirical, and possible only as knowledge a posteriori; and transcendental philosophy is itself
an absurdity.
But since, however, of those propositions which prescribe a priori the
rule to possible experience, such as, e.g., All change has its cause, it cannot be denied that they are strictly universal and necessary, and yet are
nevertheless synthetic, it follows that empiricism, which declares all this
synthetic unity of our representations in cognition to be a mere matter of
custom,21 is totally untenable, and there is a transcendental philosophy
firmly grounded in our reason, even though, if one wished to represent it as destructive of itself, another and absolutely insoluble problem
would arise. Whence do sensible objects acquire the connection and regularity of their coexistence, so that it is possible for the understanding
to bring them under general laws and discover their unity according to
principles? – for which the law of contradiction alone does not suffice,22
since in that case rationalism would inevitably have to be called in.
If we therefore find ourselves compelled to seek out an a priori principle of the possibility of experience itself, the question is, what sort of
principle is there? All representations which constitute an experience
can be assigned to sensibility, with one solitary exception, namely that
of the composite, as such.
Since compounding cannot fall under the senses, but has to be per-
20: 276 formed by ourselves, it belongs, not to the receptive nature of sensibility,
but to the spontaneity of the understanding, as an a priori concept.
Space and time, subjectively regarded, are forms of sensibility, but in
order to frame a concept of them, as objects of pure intuition (without
a question of fact . . . question of law
366What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
which we could say nothing at all about them), we require a priori the concept of a composite, and thus of the compounding (synthesis) of the manifold, and thus synthetic unity of apperception in combining this manifold; which unity of consciousness, in virtue of the diversity of intuitable
representations of objects in space and time, requires different functions
to combine them; these are called categories, and are a priori concepts of
the understanding, which do not in themselves yet found any knowledge
of an object as such, but do however found it of that which is given in
empirical intuition, which would thereupon constitute experience. The
empirical, however, i.e., that whereby an object is represented as given in
respect of its existence, is called sensation (sensatio, impressio), which constitutes the matter of experience, and, conjoined with consciousness, is
called perception, to which must be appended the form, i.e., the synthetic
unity of apperception thereof in the understanding, whereby the a priori
is thought, in order to produce experience as empirical knowledge; since
space and time themselves, wherein we must assign by concepts a place to
every object of perception, are not immediately perceived by us, a priori
principles according to mere concepts of the understanding are necessary
for this purpose, which prove their reality through sensory intuition, and,
in combination with the latter, in accordance with its a priori given form,
make possible experience, which is a quite certain knowledge a posteriori.
* *
*
But so far as outer experience is concerned, there arises against this certainty an important doubt, not as to whether knowledge of objects by
means of it might possibly be uncertain, but as to whether the object that
we posit outside us could not perhaps be always within us, so that it may
well be quite impossible to recognize anything outside us to be so with
certainty. If this question were to be left quite undecided, metaphysics
would thereby forfeit nothing of its advances, since there the perceptions
and the form of the intuition in them, from which we generate experience according to principles through the categories, may yet always be
within us, and whether anything outside us also corresponds to them or 20: 277
not makes no change in the extension of knowledge, in that we cannot
therefore hold to the objects in any case, but only to our perception,
which is always within us.

scientia).a,23
* *
*
So much has transpired of late in transcendental philosophy, and had to
transpire, before reason could make a step into metaphysics proper, or
even one towards it; inasmuch as the Leibniz–Wolfian philosophy was
always confidently pursuing its course in Germany on another tack, in
the belief that, in addition to the old Aristotelian principle of contradiction, it had handed the philosophers a new compass to guide them,
namely the principle of sufficient reason for the existence of things,24
in contrast to their mere possibility according to concepts, and likewise
that of the distinction between obscure, clear but still confused, and
distinct representations, to mark the difference between intuition and
knowledge according to concepts; though with all this elaboration it unknowingly continued always to remain in the field of logic, merely, and
had achieved not a step towards metaphysics, let alone one within it, and
thereby demonstrated that it had no clear acquaintance at all with the
distinction between synthetic and analytic judgments.25
The proposition “Everything has its ground,” which is allied to
“Everything is a consequence,” can to that extent belong only to logic,
and mark the distinction between judgments which are thought problematically and those that are meant to hold assertorically, and is purely
analytic, since if it were to be valid of things, and say that every thing
should be viewed only as a consequence of the existence of some other
thing, the sufficient reason whereby it was so viewed would be nowhere
at all to be found; against which absurdity refuge would then be sought
in the proposition that a thing (ens a se)b does indeed always have a
ground of its existence, but in itself, i.e., exists as a consequence of itself;
where, if the absurdity is not to be obvious, the proposition could hold,
not of things at all, but only of judgments, and of mere analytic judg-
20: 278 ments at that. For example, the proposition “Every body is divisible”26
does admittedly have a ground, and that within itself, i.e., it can be
viewed as inferring the predicate from the concept of the subject according to the law of contradiction, and thus by the principle of analytic
judgments; whence it is grounded merely upon an a priori principle of
logic, and advances not a step in the field of metaphysics, where it is a
matter of extending knowledge a priori, to which analytic judgments
contribute nothing. But if the supposed metaphysician wished, in
a There is no knowledge of noumena.
b thing by itself
368What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
addition to the law of contradiction, to introduce the equally logical
grounding law, he would not yet have given a complete enumeration of
the modality of judgments; for he would then have to append the law of
excluded middle between two judgments contradictorily opposed to one
another, since only so would he have propounded the logical principles
of the possibility, the truth or logical reality, and the necessity of judgments, in problematic, assertoric, and apodictic judgments, insofar as
they all stand under a single principle, namely that of the analytic judgment. This omission proves that, so far as completeness of classification
is concerned, the metaphysician himself was not even clear about logic.
But as to Leibniz’s principle of the logical difference between the indistinctness and distinctness of representations, when he claims that the
former, that mode of presentation which we were calling mere intuition,
is actually only the confused concept of its object, so that intuition differs
from concepts of things, not in kind, but only according to the degree
of consciousness, and thus the intuition, for example, of a body in thoroughgoing consciousness of all the presentations contained in it would
yield the concept of it as an aggregate of monads – to this the critical
philosopher will reply that in that way the proposition “Bodies consist
of monads” could arise from experience, merely by analysis of perception, if only we could see sharply enough (with appropriate awareness of
part-representations). But since the coexistence of these monads is represented as possible only in space, this metaphysician of the old school will
have to explain space to us as a merely empirical and confused representation of the juxtaposition of elements of the manifold outside each other.
But how, in that case, is he in a position to claim the proposition that
space has three dimensions as an apodictic proposition a priori, seeing
that by even the clearest consciousness of all part-representations of a 20: 279
body he would not have been able to demonstrate that this must be so, but
at most, only, that as perception tells him, it is so. But if he assumes space,
with its property of three dimensions, to be necessary and lying a priori
at the basis of all representations of body, how is he going to explain
this necessity, which he cannot, after all, quibble away? For this mode of
representation, on his own showing, is still of merely empirical origin,
which yields no necessity. But if he is equally willing to shrug off this
demand, and accept space, with this property it has, whatever may be the
nature of that supposedly confused representation, then geometry, and
thus reason, demonstrates to him, not by notions that hover in the air, but
by the construction of concepts, that space, and also that which occupies
it, namely body, absolutely does not consist of simple parts; albeit that if
we wanted to make the possibility of body comprehensible to ourselves by
mere ideas, we would certainly have to make the simple fundamental, by
starting from the parts and thus proceeding from them to the composite;
whereby one is then finally compelled to admit that intuition (such as
369What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
is the representation of space) and concept are modes of representation
utterly different in kind, and that the former cannot be transformed into
the latter by merely resolving the confusedness of the representation.
Precisely the same is also true of the representation of time.
How to Confer Objective Reality on the Pure Concepts
of Understanding and Reason
To represent a pure concept of the understanding as thinkable in an object of possible experience is to confer objective reality upon it, and in
general to present it. Where we are unable to achieve this, the concept is
empty, i.e., it suffices for no knowledge. If objective reality is accorded to
the concept directly (directe) through the intuition that corresponds to it,
i.e., if the concept is immediately presented, this act is called schematism;
but if it cannot be presented immediately, but only in its consequences
(indirecte), it may be called the symbolization of the concept. The first occurs with concepts of the sensible, the second is an expedient for concepts
of the super-sensible which are therefore not truly presented, and can be
20: 280 given in no possible experience, though they still necessarily appertain
to a cognition, even if it were possible merely as a practical one.
The symbol of an Idea (or a concept of reason) is a representation
of the object by analogy, i.e., by the same relationship to certain consequences as that which is attributed to the object in respect of its own
consequences, even though the objects themselves are of entirely different kinds; for example, if I conceive of certain products of Nature, such
as organized things, animals or plants, in a relation to their cause like
that of a clock to man, as its maker, viz., in a relationship of causality as
such, qua category, which is the same in both cases, albeit that the subject
of this relation remains unknown to me in its inner nature, so that only
the one can be presented, and the other not at all.
In this way I can indeed have no theoretical knowledge of the supersensible, e.g., of God, but can yet have a knowledge by analogy, and such
as it is necessary for reason to think; it is founded upon the categories,
because they necessarily pertain to the form of thinking, whether it be
directed to the sensible or the super-sensible, even though these categories constitute no knowledge, and this precisely because they do not
by themselves yet determine any object.
On the Delusiveness of Attempts to Ascribe Objective
Reality, even without Sensibility, to Concepts
of the Understanding
It is a contradiction to think, by mere concepts of the understanding,
of two things as external to one another, though in regard to all inner
370What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
determinations (of quantity and quality) they would nevertheless be entirely of a kind; it is always merely one and the same thing thought twice
over (numerically one).
This is Leibniz’s law of indiscernibility,27 to which he attaches no small
importance, though it is violently in conflict with reason, since there is no
understanding why a drop of water at one place should prevent an identical drop from being encountered at another. But this collision proves at
once that, in order to be known, things in space must be represented, not
merely through concepts of the understanding, as things-in-themselves,
but also in accordance with their sensory intuition as appearances; and
that space is not a property or relation of things-in-themselves, as Leibniz
supposed; and that pure concepts of the understanding yield no knowledge on their own.
371What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
20: 281 SECOND SECTION
Of What has been Accomplished, since the Age of Leibniz
and Wolf, in regard to the Object of Metaphysics, i.e., its
Final Goal.
The progress of metaphysics during this period can be divided into three
stages: First into that of theoretico-dogmatic advance, second into that of
skeptical stasis, and third into that of the practico-dogmatic completion
of its course, and the arrival of metaphysics at its final goal.* The first
proceeds solely within the bounds of ontology, the second within those
of transcendental or pure cosmology, which also, as a doctrine of Nature,
i.e., applied cosmology, considers the metaphysic of bodily and that of
thinking Nature; the former as object of the outer senses, the latter as
object of inner sense ( physica et psychologia rationalis),a according to what
is knowable a priori in them. The third stage is that of theology, with all
the cognitions a priori that lead to it and make it necessary. An empirical
psychology which by academic custom has been episodically interpolated
into metaphysics, is legitimately disregarded here.
First Stage of Metaphysics in the Period and Region
under Review
So far as concerns the classification of the pure concepts of the understanding, and of the a priori principles employed for experiential knowledge, as that in which ontology consists, we cannot deny to the two
philosophers in question, and especially to the celebrated Wolf, the great
merit of having displayed more clarity, precision, and urge to demonstrative thoroughness than has ever been shown previously, or outside
Germany, in the domain of metaphysics. But even without censuring
the lack of completeness, since no critique had yet established a table of
categories according to a fixed principle, the want of all intuition a priori,
20: 282 which was simply not known as a principle, and which Leibniz in fact
intellectualized, i.e., transformed into mere confused concepts, was his
reason for considering impossible what he could not make intelligible
through mere concepts of the understanding, and thus for setting up
principles which do violence even to the common understanding, and
have no tenability. Examples of the erroneous course pursued on such
principles are contained in what follows.
(1) The principle of the identity of indiscernibles ( principium identitatis indiscernibilium), that if we form of A and B, which are completely

372What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
alike in regard to all their inner determinations (of quality and quantity),
a concept of their being two things, we are mistaken, and must take them
to be one and the same thing (numero eadem).a That we can still distinguish them by position in space, because quite similar and equal spaces
can be represented outside each other, without our therefore having to
say that they are one and the same space (since in that way we could
bring the whole of infinite space into a cubic inch, and even less), was
something he could not grant, since he admitted only a distinction by
concepts, and would not recognize a mode of representation specifically
different from these, namely intuition, and a priori intuition at that; the
latter, rather, he thought he had to resolve into mere concepts of coexistence or succession, and thus he offended against common sense, which
will never let itself be persuaded that if a drop of water is at one place, this
prevents an absolutely similar and equal drop from existing at another.
(2) His principle of sufficient reason, since he did not feel obliged
to found it on any intuition a priori, but traced the idea of it to mere
a priori concepts, produced the consequence that all things, metaphysically considered, would be compounded of reality and negation, of being
and nonbeing, as in Democritus everything in the universe is made up of
atoms and void; and the ground of a negation can only be that there is no
reason why something should be posited, i.e., no reality present; and thus
out of all so-called metaphysical evil, in combination with good of that
kind, he created a world of mere light and shadows, without considering
that, in order to put a space in shadow, a body must be present, and hence
something real that prevents the light from penetrating into the space.
According to him, pain would be grounded merely on lack of pleasure,
vice merely on the want of virtuous motives, and the rest of a moving
body merely on the absence of moving force, since by mere concepts
reality = a can be contrasted, not to reality = b, but only to privation =
0 - there being no consideration of the fact that in intuition, e.g., of the
outer, a priori, namely in space, an opposition of the real (the moving 20: 283
force) to another real, namely a moving force in the opposite direction,
can be combined in one subject, and that by analogy, in inner intuition,
mutually opposed real motives can likewise be so combined, and that
the a priori knowable result of this conflict of realities might be negation. But for this purpose he would assuredly have had to assume mutually opposing directions, which can be represented only in intuition and
not in mere concepts; and thence arose the principle, at variance both
with common sense and even with morality, that all evil as ground = 0,
i.e., mere limitation, or, as the metaphysicians say, is the formal in things.
Thus his principle of sufficient reason, since he located it in mere concepts, was also not of the slightest help to him in getting beyond the
a in number the same
373What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
principle of analytic judgments, the law of contradiction, and extending
himself in synthetic a priori fashion by reason.
(3) His system of pre-established harmony, though the aim of it was
really to explain the association of mind and body, had therefore to be first
directed, in general, to explaining the possibility of communion among
different substances, whereby they constitute a whole; and there was really no way to avoid dealing with this, since substances, by their very
concept, if nothing else is added to this, must be represented as perfectly
isolated. For since in any one of them, by virtue of its subsistence, no accident may inhere that is grounded upon another substance, it being the
case, rather, that if other substances exist, it may not depend upon them
in any respect, even if they were all to depend upon a third (the primal
being) as effects of its cause, there is therefore no reason at all why the
accidents of any one substance should have to be grounded upon another
equally external in respect of this its state. So if they are nevertheless to
stand in communion as world-substances, this must only be an ideal influence and cannot be a real (physical) one, since the latter assumes the
20: 284 possibility of interaction, as though it were to be intelligible in virtue
of their mere existence (which is not in fact the case); we must, that is,
presume the author of existence to be an artist, who either so modifies on
occasion these intrinsically quite isolated substances, or has already so
fashioned them at the creation, that they harmonize together, as though
they were really influencing one another, in accordance with the relation
of cause and effect. So because the system of occasional causes does not
appear so suitable as the other for explaining everything upon a single
principle, the systema harmoniae praestabilitae,a the strangest figment ever
to be excogitated by philosophy, was therefore bound to arise, simply because everything had to be explained and made intelligible by concepts.
If, on the other hand, we take the pure intuition of space, as it underlies a priori all outer relations, and comprises but one space, all substances
are thereby bound together in relationships which make physical influence possible, and constitute a whole, so that all entities, as things in
space, together make up only one world, and cannot be a number of
worlds external to each other; which principle of world-unity, if it is to
be pursued by mere concepts, without resting it upon such an intuition,
is absolutely incapable of proof.
(4) His monadology. By mere concepts, all substances in the world
are either simple, or composed of simples. For composition is merely a
relationship, without which they would equally have to maintain their
existence as substances; but what remains over, if I do away with all
composition, is the simple. So all bodies, if they are conceived merely
through the understanding, as aggregates of substances, consist of simple
a system of pre-established harmony
374What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
substances. But all substances, apart from their relationships to one another, and the forces whereby they may have influence upon one another,
must still have certain real determinations inwardly inherent in them,
i.e., it is not enough to credit them with accidents which consist merely
in external relationships; one must also accord them internal ones, relating purely to the subject. But we know of no internal real determinations
which could be attributed to a simple, except for representations, and
what depends on them; but these, since they cannot be attributed to the
bodies, must be attributed, rather, to their simple parts, if we are not 20: 285
to presume the latter, as substances, to be internally quite empty. But
simple substances, that have in themselves the capacity for representations, are what Leibniz has called monads. So bodies consist of monads,
as mirrors of the universe, i.e., as endowed with powers of representation which differ from those of thinking substances only through lack
of consciousness, and are therefore called sleeping monads, of which we
know not whether fate might not one day awaken them, and may perhaps already have awoken infinitely many of them, one by one, and let
them fall back to sleep again, in order for them one day to awake once
more, and as animal souls to struggle up gradually into human souls, and
thence onward to higher stages; a sort of enchanted world, which that
celebrated author can only have been led to postulate in that he took
sense-representations, qua appearances, not, as he should have done, for
a mode of representation entirely different from all concepts, namely
intuition, but for a knowledge, albeit a confused one, through concepts,
which reside in the understanding and not in sensibility.
The principle of the identity of indiscernibles, the principle of sufficient
reason, the system of pre-established harmony, and lastly the monadology,
together make up the new element which Leibniz, and after him Wolf
(whose metaphysical contribution was far greater in practical philosophy), have attempted to introduce into the metaphysics of theoretical
philosophy. Whether these attempts deserve to be called progress in the
subject, though there is no denying that they may certainly have prepared for this, may at the end of this stage be left to the discretion of
those who do not let themselves be led astray by great reputations.
The theoretico-dogmatic part of metaphysics also includes the general rational theory of Nature, i.e., pure philosophy as to objects of the
senses, those of outer sense, i.e., the rational doctrine of bodies, and
those of inner sense, i.e., the rational doctrine of the soul, whereby the
principles of the possibility of an experience in general are applied to
two kinds of perceptions, without otherwise employing anything empirical as foundation, save that two such objects do exist. In both there
375What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
20: 286 can be science only insofar as mathematics, i.e., the construction of concepts, can be applied therein, and hence the spatiality of objects can do
more a priori for physics, than the form of time which underlies intuition
through inner sense, since the latter has only one dimension.
The concepts of full and empty space, of motion and moving forces,
can and must be brought in rational physics to their a priori principles,
whereas in rational psychology nothing else but the concept of the immateriality of a thinking substance, that of its change, and that of the identity
of the person amidst these changes, alone represent a priori principles;
but all else is empirical psychology, or rather mere anthropology, since
it can be shown that it is impossible for us to know whether and what
the life-principle in man (the soul) is able to do in thinking without the
body, and everything here amounts only to empirical knowledge, i.e.,
to a knowledge that we can acquire in life, and hence in a combination
of soul with body, and is thus unsuited to the final goal of metaphysics,
of attempting to pass over from the sensible to the super-sensible. The
latter is to be met with in the second stage of pure reason’s attempts in
philosophy, which we now proceed to explain.
Metaphysics: Second Stage
The first stage of metaphysics can be called that of ontology, since it
does not teach us to investigate the essence of our concepts of things by
a resolution into their elements, which is the business of logic; it tells us,
rather, what concepts of things we frame to ourselves a priori, and how,
in order to subsume thereunder whatever may be given to us in intuition
generally; which in turn could not happen save insofar as the form of
a priori intuition in space and time makes these objects knowable to us
merely as appearances, not as things-in-themselves. In this stage, reason
sees itself obliged, in a series of conditions, subordinated one to another
and each in turn conditioned without end, to progress incessantly towards the unconditioned,28 since every space and every time can never
20: 287 be represented as anything but part of a still larger given space or time,
in which the conditions for what is given to us in each intuition must
still be sought, in order to attain to the unconditioned.
The second great advance that is now expected of metaphysics is that
of getting from the conditioned in objects of possible experience to the
unconditioned, and of extending its knowledge to the completion of
this series by means of reason (for what has hitherto transpired took
place through understanding and judgment); the stage which it now
has to traverse will therefore be describable as that of transcendental
cosmology, since space and time have now to be considered in their total
magnitude, as the sum of all conditions, and represented as the containers
of all connected real things; and the totality of the latter, so far as they
376What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
occupy the former, has now to be made intelligible under the concept of
a world.
Here, and indeed in the totality of the ascending series in which they
are subordinated to one another, the synthetic conditions ( principia)
of the possibility of things, i.e., their grounds of determination ( principia
essendi), are sought for the conditioned (the principiata), in order to attain
to the unconditioned ( principium quod non est principiatum).a Reason demands this, in order to satisfy itself. With the descending series from the
condition to the conditioned it has no trouble, since for this it requires
no absolute totality, and the latter as consequence may always remain
incomplete, since the consequences follow automatically, if only we are
given the supreme ground that they depend upon.
Now it turns out that in space and time everything is conditioned,
and that the unconditioned in the ascending series of conditions is absolutely unattainable. To think the concept of an absolute whole of the
merely conditioned as unconditioned, involves a contradiction; the unconditioned can thus be considered only as a term of the series, which
delimits the latter as ground, and is itself no consequence of another
ground; and the inability to reach a ground, which runs through all
classes of the categories, insofar as they are applied to the relationship
of consequences to their grounds, is that which embroils reason with
itself in a conflict never to be settled, so long as objects in space and
time are taken for things-in-themselves, and not for mere appearances;
which before the epoch of the critique of pure reason was unavoidable,
so that thesis and antithesis were forever engaged in mutual destruction
of one another, and were bound to plunge reason into the most hopeless
skepticism; and this could not but turn out badly for metaphysics, since 20: 288
if it cannot even satisfy its demand for the unconditioned in regard to
objects of the senses, there could be no thought whatever of a transition
to the super-sensible, which is nevertheless its final goal.*
Now if, in the ascending series from the conditioned to the conditions,
we advance to a world-totality, in order to arrive at the unconditioned,
we find, in the theoretico-dogmatic cognition of a given world-totality,
the following true or merely seeming contradictions of reason with itself. First, by mathematical ideas of the composition or division of the
* The proposition that the totality of all conditioning in time and space is unconditioned, is false. For if everything in space and time is conditioned (internally), no totality thereof is possible. So those who assume an absolute totality
of mere conditioned conditions contradict themselves, whether they take it to
be bounded (finite) or unbounded (infinite); and yet space must be regarded as
such a totality, and so must elapsed time.
a principle not subject to a condition
377What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
similar; second, by dynamical ideas of the grounding of the existence of
the conditioned upon unconditioned existence.
[I. In regard to the extensive magnitude of the world in measuring it,
i.e., the repeated adding of the similar and equal unit, as the measure, in
order to obtain a definite concept of it, (a) as to its spatial magnitude, and
(b) as to its temporal extent, insofar as both are given – so that the latter
is to measure the elapsed time of its duration – reason declares of both
with equal justification that they are infinite, and yet that they are not
infinite, and thus are finite. Yet the proof of each – remarkably enough –
cannot be obtained directly, but only apagogically, i.e., by refutation of
the opposite. Thus
(a) Thesis: The world is of infinite magnitude in space, for if it were
finite it would be bounded by empty space, which itself is infinite, yet
nothing existent in itself, though it would presuppose the existence of
something as the object of a possible perception, namely that of a space
which contains nothing real, and yet would have a content as the boundary of the real, i.e., as the observable last condition of what is mutually
bounded in space; which is a contradiction. For empty space can neither
be perceived nor carry with it a (detectable) existence.
(b) Antithesis: The world is also infinite in respect of elapsed time.
20: 289 For if it had a beginning, an empty time would have preceded it, which
would likewise have made the origin of the world, and hence the nothing that preceded it, into an object of possible experience; which is a
contradiction.
II. In regard to intensive magnitude, i.e., the degree to which this magnitude occupies space or time, the following antinomy29 emerges.
(a) Thesis: Corporeal things in space consist of simple parts; for if
we suppose the opposite, the parts would indeed be substances; yet if all
their composition were taken away as mere relation, then nothing would
be left but mere space, as the simple subject of all relations. So bodies
would not consist of substances, which contradicts the thesis.
(b) Antithesis: Bodies do not consist of simple parts.]
Whether the first [type of ] antinomy arises from the fact that in the
concept of magnitude of things in the world, in both space and time, we
can ascend from the thoroughly conditioned, given parts to the unconditioned whole in the composition, or descend by division from the given
whole to the parts considered as unconditioned – whether we assume,
that is, in regard thereto, that the world is infinite as to space and elapsed
time, or that it is finite, we are inevitably embroiled in self-contradiction.
For if the world, like the space and elapsed time it occupies, is given as
infinite magnitude, it is then a given magnitude that can never be wholly
given, which is a contradiction. If every body, or every time in the change
of state of things, consists of simple parts, then since both space and
time are infinitely divisible (as mathematics demonstrates), an infinite
378What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
multitude must be given, which yet by its concept can never be wholly
given; which is likewise a contradiction.
With the second class of Ideas, of the dynamically unconditioned,
the situation is the same. For on the one hand it is argued: There is no
freedom – on the contrary, everything in the world occurs by natural
necessity. For the series of effects in relation to their causes is governed
throughout by natural mechanism, namely that every change is predetermined by the preceding state. This is countered, on the other hand,
by the following general claim of the antithesis: Some events must be
thought of as possible through freedom, and they cannot all stand under the law of natural necessity, since otherwise everything would occur
merely as conditioned, and thus nothing unconditioned would be en- 20: 290
countered in the series of causes; but to suppose a totality of conditions
in a series of the merely conditioned is a contradiction.
Finally, the thesis pertaining to the dynamic class, which is otherwise
sufficiently clear, namely that in the series of causes not everything can be
contingent, since there must, rather, be some being existing with absolute
necessity, is subject to the antithesis, that no being we can ever think of is
conceivable as absolutely necessary cause of other world-beings; a wellfounded rebuttal, since in that case it would belong with the things in the
world, as a term in the ascending series of effects and causes, in which
no causality is unconditioned, though here it would have to be assumed
as unconditioned, which is a contradiction.
Remark. If the proposition: The world is in itself infinite, is intended
to mean that it is larger than any number (in comparison with a given
measure), then that proposition is false, for an infinite number is a contradiction. If the statement be that it is not infinite, then this is doubtless
true, but then we do not know what that number may be. If I say it is
finite, then that too is false, since its boundary is not the object of a possible experience. I affirm then, in regard to both given space and elapsed
time, that it is required only for purposes of opposition. Each statement
is then false, since possible experience has neither a boundary, nor can it
be infinite, and the world as appearance is merely the object of possible
experience.
* *
*
The following observations now arise on this point:
First, the proposition that for all that is conditioned an absolutely
unconditioned must be given, holds as a principle of all things inasmuch
as their connection is conceived by pure reason, i.e., as a connection
among things-in-themselves. If we now find in practice that it cannot be
applied without contradiction to objects in space and time, then there is
379What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
no possible escape from this contradiction, unless we assume that objects
in space and time, as objects of possible experience, are not to be regarded
as things-in-themselves, but merely as appearances, whose form depends
on the subjective constitution of our mode of intuiting them.
20: 291 Thus the antinomy of pure reason leads inevitably back to that limiting
of our knowledge, and what was previously proved in the Analytic, in
dogmatic a priori fashion, is here likewise incontestably confirmed in
the Dialectic, by an experiment of reason, which it performs on its own
powers. In space and time the unconditioned is not to be met with,
though reason has need of it, and there is nothing left for the latter
to hope for, but an everlasting progression to conditions, which never
reaches completion.
Second, the conflict between these propositions of reason is not merely
a logical conflict of analytical opposition (contradictorie oppositorum), i.e., a
mere contradiction, for in that case, if one of them is true, the other would
have to be false, and conversely. E.g., the world is infinite in space, compared
to the antithesis, it is not infinite in space. It is, rather, a transcendental conflict of synthetic opposition (contrarie oppositorum), e.g., the world is finite
in space, a proposition which says more than is required for logical opposition; for it does not say merely that in the progression to conditions the
unconditioned will not be met with, but furthermore that this series of
conditions, in which one is subordinated to the other, is nevertheless in
toto an absolute whole; so that these two propositions can both of them
be false – like two judgments in logic that are contrarily opposed to one
another (contrarie opposita) – and that is what they actually are, since they
are talking of appearances as if they were things-in-themselves.
Third, the thesis and antithesis may also contain less than is needed for
logical opposition, and may both be true – like two judgments in logic
that are opposed to one another merely by difference in their subjects
( judicia subcontraria)a – as is actually the case in the antinomy of the dynamical principles; if, that is, the subject of the opposing judgments is
taken in a different meaning in each; for example, the concept of cause,
as causa phenomenon in the thesis: All causality of phenomena in the world of
sense is subject to the mechanism of Nature, seems to stand in contradiction
to the antithesis: Some causality of these phenomena is not subject to this law;
but such contradiction is not necessarily to be met with there, since in the
antithesis the subject can be taken in a different sense from that in the
thesis – the same subject, that is, can be conceived as causa noumenon,
and then both propositions may be true, and the same subject, qua
thing-in-itself, be free from determination by natural necessity, which
20: 292 qua appearance, with respect to the same action, is not free. And so too
with the concept of a necessary being.
a subcontrary judgments
380What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
Fourth, this antinomy of pure reason, which seems necessarily to bring
it to a skeptical standstill, eventually leads by way of criticism to dogmatic
advances of reason, if it turns out, that is, that such a noumenon, qua
thing-in-itself, is really and even by its own laws knowable, at least from
a practical viewpoint, even though it is super-sensible.
Freedom of choice is this super-sensible, which by moral laws is not
only given as real in the subject, but is also determinant from a practical
viewpoint with regard to the object, though theoretically it would be
quite unknowable, albeit that it is the true objective of metaphysics.
The possibility of such an advance of reason by way of dynamical ideas
is based on the fact that in them the synthesis of the true connection
of the effect with its cause, or of the contingent with the necessary,
does not have to be a combination of the similar, as in mathematical
synthesis; it is possible, rather, for ground and consequent, the condition
and the conditioned, to be different in kind, and hence in the advance
from the conditioned to the condition, from the sensible to the supersensible as supreme condition, a transition according to principles can
occur.
* *
*
Like two particular propositions, for example, the two dynamical antinomies say less than is required for opposition. So both can be true.
In the dynamical antinomies, something dissimilar can be assumed
as condition. By the same token, we there have something whereby the
super-sensible (God, who is truly the end in view) can be known, because
a law of freedom as super-sensible is given.
The ultimate purpose is directed to the super-sensible in the world
(the spiritual nature of the soul), and outside it (God), and thus to immortality and theology.
Metaphysics: Third Stage 20: 293
Practico-Dogmatic Transition to the Super-sensible
It must certainly be borne in mind from the outset, that throughout this
whole treatise, in accordance with the problem posed by the Academy,
metaphysics is intended merely as a theoretical science, or, as it can
also be called, a metaphysic of Nature; which means that its transition to
the super-sensible must not be understood as a step into a quite different rational science, the morally-practical, which can be called metaphysic of morals. For this would be to stray into a wholly different field
(µetaßas?? e ´ ?? ’ ’´ a??o ? e? ´ o? ), even though the latter also has as its
object something super-sensible, namely freedom, albeit not in respect
381What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
of what it is by nature, but rather in virtue of what it grounds for practical
principles, in regard to action and omission.
Now by all the inquiries pursued in the second stage, the unconditioned is absolutely not to be met with in Nature, i.e., in the world of the
senses, though it necessarily has to be assumed. But of the super-sensible
there is no theoretico-dogmatic knowledge (noumenorum non datur scientia). So a practico-dogmatic transition to the metaphysic of Nature
seems to contradict itself, and this third stage of it to be impossible.
But among the concepts pertaining to knowledge of Nature, whatever
they may be, we still find one having the special feature, that by means
of it we can grasp, not what is in the object, but rather what we can
make intelligible to ourselves by the mere fact of imputing it to the
object; which is therefore actually no constituent of knowledge of the
object, but still a means or ground of knowledge given by reason, and
this of theoretical, but yet not to that extent dogmatic knowledge. And
this is the concept of a purposiveness of Nature, which can also be an
object of experience, and is thus, not a transcendent, but an immanent
concept, like that of the structure of eyes and ears; though of this, so
far as experience is concerned, there is no further knowledge than what
Epicurus granted it, namely that after Nature had formed eyes and ears,
we use them for seeing and hearing, though that does not prove that
the cause producing them must itself have had the intention of forming
20: 294 this structure in accordance with the purpose in question; for this we
cannot perceive, but can only introduce by reasoning, in order merely
to recognize a purposiveness in such objects.
We thus have the concept of a teleology30 in Nature, and this a priori,
since we would otherwise have no right to introduce it into our representation of Nature’s objects, but could only extract it therefrom, as empirical intuition; and the a priori possibility of such a mode of representation,
which is still no knowledge, is based on the fact that we perceive within
ourselves a power of connecting according to purposes (nexus finalis).a
So although the physico-teleological doctrines (of purposes in
Nature) can therefore never be dogmatic, and still less are able to suggest
the concept of an ultimate purpose, i.e., the unconditioned in the series
of purposes, nevertheless the concept of freedom, as it occurs, even in
cosmology, qua sensorily-unconditioned causality, remains indeed skeptically assailed, but still unrefuted, and with it also the concept of an
ultimate purpose; from a morally-practical viewpoint such a concept
is actually unavoidable, although as with all purposiveness of given or
imagined objects generally, its objective reality cannot be assured from
a theoretico-dogmatic point of view.
a linkage to ends
382What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
This ultimate purpose of pure practical reason is the highest good,
so far as it is possible in the world, though it is to be sought not merely
in what Nature can furnish, namely happiness (the greatest amount of
pleasure); it lies, rather, in what is also the supreme requirement, or
condition, under which alone reason can accord happiness to the rational
world-being, namely that the latter’s behavior should simultaneously
conform to the utmost with the moral law.
This object of reason is super-sensible; to progress toward it, as ultimate purpose, is duty; that there has to be a stage of metaphysics for this
transition, and for progress therein, is therefore indubitable. Yet without
any theory this is still impossible, for the ultimate purpose is not wholly
within our power, and hence we must frame to ourselves a theoretical
concept of the source from which it can spring. Such a theory cannot,
however, be framed by what we cognize in objects, but at most by what
we impute to them, since the object is super-sensible. Hence this theory
will be framed only from a practico-dogmatic viewpoint, and will be able
to assure to the idea of the ultimate purpose an objective reality sufficient
only from this point of view.
As to the concept of purpose, it is framed always by ourselves, and
that of the ultimate purpose must be framed a priori through reason. 20: 295
If set forth analytically, these fabricated concepts, or rather, from a
theoretical viewpoint, transcendent Ideas, are three in number, namely
the super-sensible in us, above us, and after us:31
(1) Freedom, from which we have to start, since only from this supersensible in the world’s constitution do we know, under the name of moral
laws, the laws whereby the ultimate purpose is alone possible; and know
them a priori, which is to say dogmatically, although only in a practical
respect. So according to these laws, the autonomy of pure practical reason
is simultaneously taken to be autocracy,32 i.e., as the power, in regard to
its formal condition, namely morality, to attain this final purpose here in
our earthly life, albeit as simultaneously intelligible beings, despite all the
hindrances which the influence of Nature may exert upon us as sensory
beings. This is the belief in virtue, as the principle in us, for attaining to
the highest good.
(2) God, the all-sufficing principle of the highest good above us, who
as moral world-creator makes up for our incapacity even in regard to the
material condition of this final purpose, that of a happiness in the world
commensurate to morality.
(3) Immortality, i.e., the continuance of our existence after us, as mortals, with those infinitely continuing moral and physical consequences
which are commensurate to the moral behavior of such beings.
When set forth according to a synthetic method, these same stages
in the practico-dogmatic knowledge of the super-sensible begin from
the unrestricted possessor of the highest original good, go on to what
383What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
is derived (through freedom) in the world of sense, and end with the
consequences of this objective final purpose of man in an intelligible
future world; and so here they stand systematically connected in the
sequence: God, Freedom, and Immortality.
As to the fitness of human reason in determining these concepts to a
real knowledge, it requires no proof, and metaphysics, which has become
a necessary inquiry, precisely in order to achieve such knowledge, needs
20: 296 no justification for its unceasing endeavors to that end. But has it, since
the days of Leibniz and Wolf, discovered anything, and how much has it
discovered, and what can it discover in general, in regard to that supersensible whose knowledge is its final goal? That is the question which
has to be answered, if it is addressed to the fulfilment of that ultimate
purpose for which metaphysics in general is supposed to exist.
384Resolution of the Problem Posed
by the Academy
i
What Sort of Progress can Metaphysics achieve in regard
to the Super-sensible?
It has been sufficiently demonstrated by the critique of pure reason that
there can be absolutely no theoretical knowledge beyond the objects of
the senses, nor any theoretico-dogmatic knowledge, since in that case
everything would have to be known a priori through concepts; and this
for the simple reason, that all concepts must be capable of resting upon
an intuition of some sort, to provide them with objective reality; but
all our intuition is sensuous. That means, in other words, that we can
know nothing whatever of the nature of super-sensible objects, of God,
of our own capacity for freedom, or of our soul (in separation from the
body); nor anything as to this inner principle of all that pertains to the
existence of these things, their consequences and effects, whereby their
appearances could be even in the slightest degree explicable to us, and
their principle, the object itself, be possible for us to know.
Thus the only question now still at issue is whether, in spite of
that, there could not be a practico-dogmatic knowledge of these supersensible objects, which would then constitute the third stage of metaphysics, and that which fulfilled its entire purpose.
In this case we would have to investigate the super-sensible thing, not
in respect of what it is in itself, but only with regard to how we have to
think it, and assume its nature to be, in order for it to be apposite, for
ourselves, to the practico-dogmatic object of the pure moral principle,
namely the final end, which is the highest good. We should not, then,
be instituting inquiries as to the nature of the things which we frame to
ourselves, and this merely for necessary practical purposes, and which
perhaps have no existence at all outside our idea and maybe could not
exist (though this otherwise involves no contradiction), since in doing so 20: 297
we might merely be lapsing into extravagance; we simply want to know
what sort of moral principles of action are incumbent on us, in accordance
with that idea which reason necessarily and inevitably frames for us;
and here would ensue a practico-dogmatic knowledge and acquaintance
with the nature of the object, along with complete renunciation of any
385What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
theoretical knowledge (suspensio judicii);a and as to the first it is almost
solely a matter of the name we confer upon this modality of our assent,
so that it should not contain too little for such a purpose (as in mere
opining), yet also not too much (as in taking to be probable), and thus
concede victory to the skeptic.
Persuasion,33 however, which is a form of assent of which we cannot make out on our own whether it rests on merely subjective, or on
objective grounds, as distinct from merely felt conviction, in which the
subject thinks himself to be conscious of those objective grounds, and
of their sufficiency, though he cannot name them or get clear as to their
connection with the object, can neither of them be reckoned among the
modalities of assent in dogmatic knowledge, whether it be theoretical or
practical, since the latter is meant to be a knowledge from principles, and
must therefore also be capable of a clear, intelligible and communicable
representation.
The meaning of this form of assent, distinct from the opinion and
knowledge that are founded on judgment in the theoretical sense, can
now be expressed in the term belief, whereby we understand an assumption, presupposition or hypothesis, which is necessary only because it is
necessarily implied by an objective practical rule of conduct, as to which
we do not, indeed, theoretically discern the possibility of its performance,
or of the resultant object in itself, but yet subjectively recognize in that
possibility the only way for them to accord with the final end.
Such a belief is the assent to a theoretical proposition, e.g., there is
a God, by practical reason, considered here as pure practical reason,
where, in that the final end, the accordance of our striving to the highest
good, stands under an absolutely necessary practical rule, namely a moral
rule, whose effect, however, we can conceive to be possible no otherwise
than by presupposing the existence of an original highest good, we are
necessitated a priori to assume this from a practical point of view.
20: 298 Thus for that section of the public which has nothing to do with
the corn trade, the prospect of a bad harvest is a mere opinion, once
the drought has persisted for the entire spring, and after that a piece
of knowledge; but for the merchant, whose purpose and occupation is to
profit by this trade, it is a belief that the harvest will turn out badly, and
that he must therefore husband his supplies, because he must resolve to
do something about it, in that it bears upon his occupation and business;
save only that the necessity of this decision, taken by rules of prudence, is
merely conditioned, whereas one that presupposes a moral maxim rests
on a principle that is absolutely necessary.
Hence belief, in a morally-practical context, also has a moral value
on its own account, since it contains a free affirmation. The Credo in
a suspension of judgment
386What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
the three articles of confession of pure practical reason: I believe in one
God, as the original source of all good in the world, that being its final
end; – I believe in the possibility of conforming to this final end, to the
highest good in the world, so far as it is in man’s power; – I believe in
a future eternal life, as the condition for an everlasting approximation
of the world to the highest good possible therein; – this Credo, I say, is
a free affirmation, without which it would also have no moral value. It
permits of no imperative, therefore (no crede),a and the argument for
its correctness is no proof of the truth of these propositions, considered
as theoretical, and thus no objective teaching as to the reality of their
objects, for in regard to the super-sensible this is impossible; instead, it
is merely an injunction, subjectively and indeed practically valid, and in
this respect sufficient, so to act, as though we knew that these objects
were real. Nor must this mode of representation be regarded here either
as necessary in a technico-practical sense, as a prudential doctrine (better to profess too much than too little); because in that case the belief
would not be sincere. It is necessary only in a moral sense, in order to
add a supplement of the theory of the possibility of that to which we
are already ipso facto constrained, namely to strive for promotion of the
highest good in the world; and to add this by mere ideas of reason, in
that we simply frame these objects, God, freedom in its practical aspect, 20: 299
and immortality, in consequence of the demand of the moral law within
us, and voluntarily grant them objective reality, since we are assured
that no contradiction can be found in these ideas, and since the effect
of assuming them, upon the subjective principles of morality and their
reinforcement, and thus upon action and omission themselves, is again
by intention of a moral kind.
But should there not also be theoretical proofs of the truth of these
articles of faith, of which it might be said that in virtue of them it is
probable that a God exists, that a moral order will be met with in the world,
conforming to His will and appropriate to the idea of the highest good,
and that for every human being there is a future life? The answer is that
in this application the expression of probability is altogether absurd. For
the probable ( probabile) is that which has a reason for assenting to it which
is greater than half of the sufficient reason, and is thus a mathematical
determination of the modality of the assent, where the elements thereof
must be assumed to be similar, so that an approximation to certainty is
possible; whereas the ground of the more or less likely (verosimile) can
also consist of dissimilar reasons, which is precisely why its relation to
the sufficient reason cannot be known at all.
But now the super-sensible differs in its very species (toto genere)
from the sensuously knowable, since it lies beyond all knowledge that is
a I believe . . . thou shalt believe
387What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
possible to us. Hence there is no way at all of reaching it by those very
same steps whereby we may hope to arrive at certainty in the field of the
sensible; thus there is no approximation to it either, and therefore no
assent whose logical value could be called probability.
From a theoretical viewpoint, the most strenuous efforts of reason do
not bring us nearer in the least to conviction of the existence of God,
the existence of the highest good, or the prospect of a future life, since
we have no insight whatever into the nature of super-sensible objects.
But in a practical point of view, we frame these objects to ourselves,
inasmuch as we judge the idea of them to be helpful to the final end of
our pure reason; which final end, since it is morally necessary, can then
20: 300 admittedly produce the illusion of believing that what has reality in a
subjective context, namely for the use of man’s freedom, is also, since it
has been presented to experience in actions that conform to this its law,
a knowledge of the existence of the object corresponding to this form.
By this time we can now describe the third stage of metaphysics in the
progression of pure reason to its final goal. It takes the form of a circle,
whose boundary line returns into itself, and thus includes a totality of
knowledge of the super-sensible, outside which there is nothing more
of this kind, and yet which also comprises everything that can suffice
for the needs of this reason. For once it has freed itself from everything
empirical, wherein it was still always embroiled in the first two stages, and
from the conditions of sensory intuition, whereby it was presented with
objects only in appearance, and has stationed itself at the standpoint
of Ideas, whence it considers its objects in terms of what they are in
themselves, then reason describes their horizon; setting out theoreticodogmatically, from freedom as a super-sensible capacity, though one
that can be known through the canon of morality, it returns there also
in a practico-dogmatically oriented direction, i.e., one addressed to the
final end, namely the highest good to be promoted in the world, whose
possibility is reinforced by the ideas of God and immortality, and the
confidence, dictated by morality itself, of achieving this purpose, and
thus confers upon this concept an objective but practical reality.
The propositions: there is a God; there exists in the nature of the world
an original, though incomprehensible, propensity to conform with moral
purposiveness; there exists, finally, in the human soul a disposition which
renders it capable of a neverending progression towards this; – to wish to
prove these propositions in a theoretico-dogmatic sense would amount
to a plunge into transcendence, though so far as the second of them is
concerned, the elucidation of it by way of the physical purposiveness
to be met with in the world can do much to fortify the assumption of
this moral purposiveness. The same is true of the modality of assent,
388What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
the imagined knowing and acquaintance wherein we forget that these
Ideas have been arbitrarily framed by ourselves, and are not derived
from the objects, and thus entitle us to nothing more than assumption in
a theoretical sense, though they also allow us to maintain the rationality
of such an assumption from a practical point of view. 20: 301
Now from this there follows also the notable consequence that in its
third stage, in the field of theology, and precisely because it is directed
to the final goal, the progress of metaphysics is the easiest of all, and
although it is concerned here with the super-sensible, does not become
transcendent, but is just as intelligible to ordinary human reason as to
the philosophers, and this to such a point that the latter are obliged
to orient themselves by the former, lest they lapse into transcendency.
Philosophy as doctrine of wisdom enjoys this advantage over philosophy
as speculative science by virtue of arising from nothing else but pure
practical rationality, i.e., morality, so far as it has been derived from the
concept of freedom, as a principle super-sensible, indeed, but practically
knowable a priori.
The fruitlessness of all attempts of metaphysics to extend itself
theoretico-dogmatically in that which concerns its final purpose, namely
the super-sensible – first in regard to knowledge of the divine nature, as
the highest original good; second in regard to knowledge of the nature
of a world, in which and through which the highest derived good is
supposed to be possible; and third in regard to knowledge of human nature, insofar as it is endowed with the natural constitution requisite to
a progression appropriate to this final goal; – the fruitlessness, I say, of
all attempts made therein up to the close of the Leibniz–Wolf epoch,
and likewise the inevitable miscarriage of all that are yet to be instituted in future, should now demonstrate that metaphysics has no hope
of arriving at its final goal by the theoretico-dogmatic route, and that
all supposed knowledge in this field is transcendent, and thus altogether
empty.
Transcendent Theology34
Reason, in metaphysics, seeks to create for itself a concept of the origin of
all things, the primal being (ens originarium) and its inner constitution,
and begins subjectively from the primal concept (conceptus originarius)
of thinghood as such (realitas), i.e., of that whose concept intrinsically
represents a being, rather than a nonbeing; albeit that in order to also
conceive objectively the unconditioned in this primal being, it represents
the latter as containing the all (omnitudo) of reality (ens realissimum), and
thus thoroughly determines the concept of it, as that of the highest being; 20: 302
which no other concept can do, and which, so far as the possibility of
such a being is concerned, creates – as Leibniz adds – no difficulty in
389What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
proving it, since realities, as positive affirmations, cannot contradict one
another, and what is thinkable because its concept does not contradict
itself, i.e., everything whose concept is possible, is also a possible thing;
at which reason, however, guided by critique, ought certainly to shake
its head.
And so too should metaphysics, if here it is not just taking concept
for thing, but also thing, or rather the name of it, for concept, and thus
ratiocinating itself totally into the void.
It is true that if we wish to frame to ourselves a concept of a thing as
such, and thus ontologically, we always lay down in thought, as primal
concept, the notion of a most real being of all; for a negation, as determination of a thing, is always a merely derived representation, since one
cannot think of it as a removal (remotio), without having first thought of
the reality opposed to it as something that is posited ( positio seu reale);a
and hence, if we make this subjective condition of thinking into an objective condition of the possibility of things themselves, all negations
have to be regarded merely as limitations of the conceptual sum-total of
realities, and everything else but this one concept of their possibility as
merely derived from this.
This One which metaphysics – we wonder how – has now conjured
up for itself, is the highest metaphysical good. It contains the wherewithal for the creation of all other possible things, as the marble quarry
does for statues of infinite diversity, which are all of them possible only
through limitation (separation of a certain part of the whole from the
rest, and hence solely through negation); and so evil differs from good
in the world merely as the formal side of things, like shadows in the
sunlight that irradiates the whole universe; and things of this world are
evil only because they are mere parts, and do not constitute the whole,
being partly real and partly negative; in which carpentering of a world
this metaphysical God (the realissimum) likewise falls very much under
the suspicion (despite all protestations against Spinozism),35 that as a
universally existing being He is identical with the universe.
But, waiving all these objections, let us now examine the supposed
proofs of the existence of such a being, which may for this reason be
20: 303 called ontological.
Here there are only two arguments, nor can there be any others.
Either we infer from the concept of the most real being to its existence,
or from the necessary existence of something to a determinate concept
that we have to frame of it.
The first argument proceeds as follows: A metaphysically most perfect
of all beings must necessarily exist, since if it did not exist it would be
lacking in a perfection, namely existence.
a postulated or real
390What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
The second argues conversely: A being that exists as a necessary being
must have all perfection, since if it did not have all perfection (reality) in
itself, it would not be thoroughly determined as a priori by its concept,
and so could not be thought of as a necessary being.
The deficiency in the first proof, in which existence is conceived as a
special determination, superadded to the concept of a thing, whereas it
is merely the positing of the thing with all its determinations, by which
this concept is not therefore enlarged at all – this deficiency, I say, is so
evident that there is no occasion to dwell upon this proof, which already
seems, in any case, to have been abandoned by the metaphysicians as
untenable.
The argument of the second is more plausible, in that it does not
attempt to enlarge knowledge a priori by mere concepts, but relies upon
experience, albeit only the experience, in general, that something exists;
and now concludes from this that, because all existence must be either
necessary or contingent, though the latter always presupposes a cause
that can have its complete ground only in a noncontingent and thus
necessary being, there exists a being, therefore, of the latter kind.
Now since we can know the necessity of a thing’s existing, like any
other necessity, only so far as we derive its existence a priori from concepts, while the concept of something existing is a concept of a thing
that is thoroughly determinate, the concept of a necessary being will be
one which contains at the same time the thoroughgoing determinacy of
this thing. But we have only one such concept, namely that of the most
real being of all. Hence the necessary being is a being that contains all
reality, whether as ground or as totality.
This is an advance of metaphysics through the back door. It wishes
to demonstrate a priori, and yet relies upon an empirical datum, which it
uses to apply its lever, as Archimedes36 did with his fixed point outside the 20: 304
earth (though here it is on the earth), and so attempts to raise knowledge
up to the super-sensible.
But if, granting the proposition that something absolutely necessary
exists, it is likewise equally certain that we can frame absolutely no concept of anything existing in this fashion, and hence are utterly unable to
determine it as such according to its nature (for the analytical predicates,
i.e., those that are merely identical with the concept of necessity, such
as the immutability, eternity, and even the simplicity of the substance,
are not determinations, so that even the unity of such a being cannot
be proved at all) – if, I say, the attempt to frame a concept of it fares
so badly, then the concept of this metaphysical God remains always an
empty one.
It is absolutely impossible, moreover, to define exactly the concept of
a being, of such a nature that a contradiction would arise if I were to
abolish it in thought, even supposing that I assume it to be the whole
391What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
of reality. For a contradiction occurs in a judgment only if I abolish a
predicate therein, and yet retain in the concept of the subject a predicate
identical with this – never, though, if I abolish the thing along with all of
its predicates, and say, for example, that there is no most real being of all.
Hence we can frame no concept whatever of an absolutely necessary
thing as such (the reason being that it is a mere concept of modality,
which contains no relation to the object as a property of the thing, and
pertains to it merely by linking the representation of it to the faculty of
cognition). So from its presupposed existence we cannot infer in the least
to determinations which extend our knowledge of it beyond the idea of its
necessary existence, and might thus form the basis of a kind of theology.
Hence the proof which some call the cosmological, though it is actually transcendental (since it does in fact assume an existent world),
and which might equally well be assigned to ontology (since it does not
profess to have inferred anything from the nature of a world, but only
from presupposing the concept of a necessary being, i.e., from a pure
rational concept a priori), sinks, like its predecessor, back into its own
nothingness.
20: 305 Transition of Metaphysics to the Super-sensible
since the Epoch of Leibniz and Wolf
The first stage in the transition of metaphysics to that super-sensible
which underlies Nature, in that it is the supreme condition of everything conditioned therein, and is thus made fundamental to theory, is
the transition to theology; to a knowledge, that is, of God, albeit only
by an analogy of the concept thereof to that of an intelligent being, as
a primal ground of all things, essentially distinct from the world. Such
a theory does not itself proceed from reason in its theoretical aspect,
but only in a practico-dogmatic and thus subjectively moral sense. It is
brought in, that is, not to ground morality as to its laws, or even its final
purpose, for here these are postulated, rather, as subsisting for themselves; it is to confer reality on this idea of the highest good possible
in a world (a good which, objectively and theoretically regarded, lies
beyond our power) with reference to this good, and thus in a practical point of view; for which purpose the mere possibility of conceiving
such a being becomes sufficient, and at the same time a transition to
this super-sensible, a knowledge of it, becomes possible, but only in a
practico-dogmatic sense.
This, then, is an argument to prove God’s existence as a moral being,
sufficiently for human reason so far as the latter is morally practical,
i.e., sufficiently for assuming that existence; and an argument to ground
a theory of the super-sensible, but only as a practico-dogmatic transition thereto; and thus really not a proof of God’s existence absolutely
392What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
(simpliciter), but only in a certain respect (secundum quid), namely in relation to the final end which the moral man has and should have, and
thus with reference merely to the rationality of assuming such a being;
whereby man is then enabled to accord influence upon his decisions to
an idea which he frames for himself, on moral principles, exactly as if he
had drawn this idea from a given object.
Theology of such a kind is admittedly not theosophy,37 i.e., knowledge
of the divine nature, which is unattainable; it is a knowledge, rather, of
the inscrutable determining ground of our willing, which we find, in
ourselves alone, to be inadequate to its final ends, and therefore assume
it in another, the supreme being above us, in order, through the idea of
a super-sensible Nature, to furnish this willing with the supplement, as
yet lacking to theory, whereby it may conform to what practical reason
prescribes for it. 20: 306
The moral argument would thus be describable as an argumentum
?at’ a????p ’´ o?,38 valid for men as rational creatures generally, and
not merely for the contingently adopted thought-habit of this man or
that; and would have to be distinguished from the theoretico-dogmatic
?at’ a? ’´ ??e? ´ o?, which claims more to be certain than man can possibly
know.
II
Supposed Theoretico-Dogmatic Advances
in Moral Theology, during the Epoch
of Leibniz and Wolf
For this stage in the progress of metaphysics the philosophy in question
admittedly made no special provision, but attached it, rather, to theology,
in the chapter on the final end of creation; but it is included, nevertheless,
in the explanation given thereof, namely that this final purpose is the glory
of God,39 which can mean nothing else but that in the real world there is
a combination of purposes such as to contain, on the whole, the highest
good possible in a world, and thus the teleologically supreme condition
for its existence, and to be worthy of a God as its moral creator.
But if not the whole, at least the supreme condition of the world’s perfection consists in the morality of rational beings, which in turn depends
on the concept of freedom; of which, as unconditioned self-activity, these
beings must again themselves be conscious, if they are to be capable of
being morally good. But on such a presupposition it is utterly impossible
to view them theoretically, in accordance with this their purposiveness,
as beings that have arisen by creation, and thus by the will of another;
as one may certainly ascribe this, in nonrational creatures, to a cause
distinct from the world, and can therefore conceive them as endowed to
an infinitely varied extent with physico-teleological perfection; whereas
393What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
morally-teleological perfection, which must have its original ground in
the man himself, cannot be the effect, nor therefore the purpose either,
which another might take it upon himself to bring about.
Now man, from a theoretico-dogmatic viewpoint, is quite unable to
comprehend the possibility of the final purpose which he is required
20: 307 to strive for, though without having it fully within his power; for if he
bases its furtherance upon the physical aspect of such a teleology, he
abolishes the morality which is nevertheless its principal component;
while if he founds the end wholly on a moral basis, he is deprived of
that which compensates his inability to delineate such an end, in the
coupling with the physical, which equally cannot be separated from the
concept of the highest good, as his final purpose. Yet there remains
to him, nevertheless, a practico-dogmatic principle of transition to this
ideal of world-perfection, namely – and despite the obstacles placed in
the path of such progress by the course of the world-as-appearance –
to assume therein, as object-in-itself, a morally teleological connection,
such that, by an ordering of Nature beyond his comprehension, it tends
to the final purpose, as super-sensible goal of his practical reason, namely
the highest good.
That the world as a whole is constantly improving, no theory entitles
him to assume; but he is so entitled by practical reason, which dogmatically bids him to act on such a hypothesis, and so by this principle he
fashions a theory, to which he cannot, indeed, ascribe more than thinkability in this respect; from a theoretical viewpoint, that is by no means
sufficient to prove the objective reality of this ideal, though it is quite
satisfactory to reason from a morally-practical point of view.
So what is impossible in a theoretical respect, namely the progress of
reason to the super-sensible of the world we live in (mundus noumenon),a
i.e., to the highest derived good, is actual in a practical respect, viz.,
to present the course of man’s life here upon earth as if it were a life in
heaven. On the analogy, that is, with the physical teleology which Nature
allows us to perceive, we can and should assume a priori (even independent of this perception), that the world is destined to coincide with the
object of moral teleology, namely the final purpose of all things according to laws of freedom; and this in order to strive toward the Idea of the
highest good, which, as a moral product, demands man himself as originator (so far as it is in his power), and whose possibility, either by creation
based upon an external author, or by insight into the capacity of human
nature to be adapted to such a purpose, is not, theoretically speaking, a
tenable concept, as the Leibniz–Wolfian philosophy supposes, but rather
20: 308 a transcendent one; though from a practico-dogmatic viewpoint, it is,
however, a real concept and sanctioned by practical reason for our duty.

III
Supposed Theoretico-Dogmatic Advance
of Metaphysics in Psychology, in the Epoch
of Leibniz and Wolf
Psychology,40 for human understanding, is nothing more, and can become nothing more, than anthropology, i.e., than a knowledge of man,
albeit restricted to the condition: So far as he is acquainted with himself
as object of inner sense. He is, however, also conscious of himself as
object of his outer senses, i.e., he has a body linked with that object of
inner sense which is called the soul of man.
That he is not wholly and solely a body can (if this appearance be considered as thing-in-itself ) be rigorously proved, since the unity of consciousness, which must necessarily be met with in every cognition (and
so likewise in that of himself ), makes it impossible that representations
distributed among many subjects should constitute unity of thought;
hence materialism can never be employed as a principle for explaining
the nature of our soul.
If, however, we consider both body and soul as phenomena, merely,
which is not impossible, since both are objects of sense, and bear in
mind that the noumenon which underlies this appearance, i.e., the outer
object, as thing-in-itself, may perhaps be a simple being. . . .a
But disregarding this difficulty, i.e., if both soul and body are assumed
to be two specifically different substances, whose association constitutes
man, it remains impossible for all philosophy, and especially for metaphysics, to make out what and how much the soul, and what or how much
the body itself may contribute to the representations of inner sense; or
whether, indeed, if one of these substances were split off from the other,
the soul, perhaps, would not absolutely forfeit every kind of representation (intuition, sensation, and thinking).
Hence it is absolutely impossible to know whether, after a man’s death, 20: 309
when his material part is dispersed, the soul, even if its substance remains
over, is able to go on living, i.e., to continue to think and will; whether,
that is, it be a spirit41 or not (for by this term we understand a being which,
even without a body, can be conscious of itself and its representations).
The metaphysics of Leibniz and Wolf has, indeed, given us much
in the way of theoretico-dogmatic demonstration on this subject, i.e.,
has professed to prove, not only the future life of the soul, but even the
impossibility of losing it by human death, i.e., its immortality; but has
been able to convince nobody. On the contrary, it can be seen a priori
that such a proof is quite impossible, because it is inner experience alone
whereby we know ourselves, and all experience can be engaged in only in
a [There is a blank left in the manuscript at this point (Rink).]
395What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
life, i.e., if soul and body are still linked together; hence we are absolutely
unacquainted with what we shall be, and be capable of, after death, and so
cannot know the separated nature of the soul at all. We would therefore
have to rely, say, on making trial of translating the soul out of the body
while still alive, which would be not unlike the experiment which the man
attempted by closing his eyes in front of the mirror, and when asked his
purpose in doing so replied: I just wanted to know how I look when I’m
asleep.
From a moral point of view, however, we do have sufficient reason to
assume a life for man after death (the end of his earthly life) and even for
eternity, and hence the immortality 42 of the soul; and this doctrine is a
practico-dogmatic transition to the super-sensible, i.e., to that which is
a mere Idea, and can be no object of experience, yet possesses objective
reality, albeit valid only in a practical sense. The onward striving to the
highest good, as ultimate purpose, compels the assumption of a duration proportionate to so endless a task, and covertly supplies the want of
any theoretical proof, so that the metaphysician does not feel the insufficiency of his theory, because in secret the moral influence allows him
not to perceive the deficiency of the knowledge he has supposedly drawn
from the nature of things, which in this case is impossible.
These, then, are the three stages in the transition of metaphysics to
20: 310 the super-sensible, in which its true final end consists. It was a vain labor that it traditionally gave itself, to reach the super-sensible by way of
speculation and theoretical knowledge, and thus that science became the
leaking sieve of the Danaids.43 It was not until the moral laws unveiled
the super-sensible in man, namely freedom (whose possibility no reason
can explain, though it can prove the reality thereof in those practicodogmatic teachings), that reason made proper claim to knowledge of
the super-sensible, though only when confined to its use in the latter
capacity; for then there appears a certain organization of pure practical
reason, in which first the subject of universal law-giving, as world-creator,
second the object of the creatures’ willing, as their appropriate final purpose, and third the state of the latter in which alone they are capable of
reaching it, are self-created Ideas in a practical sense, though they must
not, of course, be asserted in a theoretical one; because if so they turn
theology into theosophy, moral teleology into mysticism, and psychology into a pneumatics, whereby things of which we might make some
use for knowledge in a practical respect are misplaced into the realm
of transcendence, where they are, and remain, quite inaccessible to our
reason.
Metaphysics, on this showing, is itself only the Idea of a science, as a
system which, after completion of the critique of pure reason, can and
396What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
should be constructed, and for which, indeed, the building materials
and specifications are to hand: a whole which, like pure logic, neither
needs nor is capable of any enlargement, and must likewise be constantly
occupied and kept in structural repair, if spiders and satyrs, who will
never be backward in seeking accommodation here, are not to settle in
and make it uninhabitable for reason.
Nor is this structure extensive, but for the sake of elegance, which
consists essentially in its precision, not to say clarity, it will have need
of the combined efforts and judgment of a variety of artists, in order
to render it eternal and immutable; and thus the project of the Royal
Academy, not merely to enumerate the advances of metaphysics, but also
to measure out the stage it has traversed, would be fully accomplished
in the modern critical age.
Supplement in Review of the Whole 20: 311
If a system is so constructed that firstly, any principle in it is demonstrable for itself, and that secondly, if one were to be anxious about its
correctness, it still also leads unavoidably, as a mere hypothesis, to all its
other principles as consequences, then nothing more whatever can be
demanded in order to acknowledge its truth.
Now that is actually the case with metaphysics, if the critique of reason pays careful attention to all its steps, and takes account of where
they ultimately lead to. For there are two hinges on which it turns:
First, the doctrine of the ideality of space and time, which in regard to
theoretical principles merely points toward the super-sensible, but for us
unknowable, in that on its way to this goal, where it is concerned with the
knowledge a priori of objects of sense, it is theoretico-dogmatic; second,
the doctrine of the reality of the concept of freedom, as that of a knowable super-sensible, in which metaphysics is still only practico-dogmatic.
But both hinges are sunk, as it were, into the doorpost of the rational
concept of the unconditioned in the totality of all mutually subordinated
conditions, where there is need to remove that illusion which creates an
antinomy of pure reason, by confusion of appearances with things-inthemselves, and which contains, in this very dialectic, an invitation to
make the passage from the sensible to the super-sensible.

the Third Manuscript
INTRODUCTION
The task proposed by the Royal Academy of Sciences tacitly contains
20: 315
two questions within it:
I. Whether metaphysics, from time immemorial until immediately
after the days of Leibniz and Wolf, has taken even a single step in what
constitutes its true purpose and the ground of its existence; for only if
this has occurred, can we ask about the further advances that it might
have made subsequent to a certain point in time.
II. The second question is: Whether the supposed advances of metaphysics are real.
What is called metaphysics (for I refrain, as yet, from a specific definition of it) must certainly, at any given time after a name had been found
for it, have had some sort of domain. But only that domain which it was
intended to gain possession of by working at it, and which thus constitutes
its aim – not the stock of means collected for that purpose – is that of
which an accounting is now demanded, when the Academy asks whether
this science has made real advances.
In one of its parts (ontology), metaphysics contains elements of human
knowledge a priori, both in concepts and principles, and must by intent
contain them; by far the greatest part of them, however, finds application in the objects of possible experience, e.g., the concept of a cause,
20: 316 and the principle that all change is related thereto. But for purposes of
knowing such experiential objects, a metaphysics has never yet been undertaken in which those principles were carefully sifted out, and they
have often, indeed, been so unhappily demonstrated on a priori grounds,
that if the unavoidable procedure of the understanding in accordance
with those principles, whenever we engage in experience, and their continuous confirmation thereby, had not done their best, there would have
been but poor prospects of convincing anyone of such a principle by
rational demonstration. In physics (if we take this, in its most general
398What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
meaning, to signify the science of the rational knowledge of all objects of
possible experience), these principles have at all times been employed as
though they belonged within its sphere (the physical), without separating them off on the ground that they are a priori principles, or creating
a special science for them; because, after all, the purpose they were used
for extended only to objects of experience, in which connection, also,
they could alone be made intelligible to us, though this was not the true
purpose of metaphysics. So in regard to this use of reason there would
never have been any thought of metaphysics, as a separate science, if
reason had not found within itself a higher interest in the enterprise,
for which the unearthing and systematic combination of all elementary
concepts and principles that are the a priori foundation of our knowledge
of the objects of experience, was merely a preparation.
The old name of this science, µeta t ` a f?s?? ` a´ , already gives a
pointer to the kind of knowledge at which its aim was directed. The
purpose is to proceed by means of it beyond all objects of possible experience (trans physicam), in order, where possible, to know that which
absolutely cannot be an object thereof, and hence the definition of metaphysics, which contains the reason for advocating such a science, would
be: It is a science of progressing from knowledge of the sensible to that of
the super-sensible (by the sensible here I mean nothing more than that
which can be an object of experience. That everything sensible is mere
appearance, and not the object-of-representation in itself, will be proved
later on). Now because this cannot occur by way of empirical grounds
of knowledge, metaphysics will contain a priori principles, and although
mathematics likewise has them, albeit always only such as refer to objects
of possible sensory intuition, with which one cannot, however, get out to
the super-sensible, metaphysics will nevertheless differ therefrom by be- 20: 317
ing marked out as a philosophical science, which is a totality of rational
knowledge a priori, from concepts (without constructing them). Because,
in the end, to extend knowledge beyond the bounds of the sensible, there
is first of all need for a complete acquaintance with all a priori principles,
which are also applied to the sensible, metaphysics, if it is to be explained
not so much by its purpose, but rather by the means of attaining to a
knowledge of any sort by a priori principles, i.e., by the mere form of its
procedure, must be defined as the system of all pure rational knowledge
of things through concepts.
Now it can be stated with the utmost certainty, that up to the time of
Leibniz and Wolf, and including both of them, metaphysics, in regard
to this its essential purpose, had yielded not the slightest return, not
even that of the mere concept of any super-sensible object, such that it
could simultaneously have proved in theory the reality of this concept,
which would have constituted the smallest possible progression to the
super-sensible; where knowledge of this object posited beyond all possible
399What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
experience would still have continued to be lacking, and where even
if transcendental philosophy had obtained some enlargement, here or
there, in regard to its a priori concepts which are valid for objects of
experience, this would not yet have been that envisaged by metaphysics;
whence it can justly be maintained that, up to that point in time, this
science had still made no progress whatever to its own destination.
We know, therefore, what advances of metaphysics are being asked
about, and what it actually has to make, and can distinguish the a priori
knowledge whose consideration serves only as a means, and which does
not constitute the aim of this science – namely that which, though
grounded a priori, can nonetheless find the objects for its concepts in
experience – from the knowledge which does constitute the aim, in that
its object lies beyond all bounds of experience, and which metaphysics,
beginning from the former, does not so much step up to, as rather wish
to step over to, since it is separated therefrom by an immeasurable chasm.
Aristotle, with his categories, adhered almost solely to the first kind of
knowledge, while Plato, with his Ideas, was striving for the second. But
after this preliminary assessment of the matter with which metaphysics
is concerned, we must also give consideration to the form in which it is
supposed to proceed.
20: 318 For the second demand that is tacitly contained in the task prescribed
by the Royal Academy would require it to be proved that the advances
which metaphysics may boast of having made are real. A severe demand,
which alone must plunge the numerous supposed conquerors in this field
into embarrassment, if they wish to grasp and take it to heart.
As for the reality of those elementary concepts of all a priori knowledge
which can find their objects in experience, and likewise the principles
whereby these objects are subsumed under those concepts, experience
itself can serve to demonstrate their reality, even though we do not see
how it is possible for them, being underived from experience, and hence
a priori, to have their origin in the pure understanding; e.g., the concept
of a substance, and the principle that in all changes substance persists,
and only the accidents arise or pass away. That this step of metaphysics
is real, and not just imagined, the physicist assumes without hesitation;
for he employs it with great success in all researches into Nature that
proceed by way of experience, confident of never being refuted by a single
instance, not because an experience has never yet refuted it, though he
also cannot prove the principle, exactly as it is to be met with a priori in
the understanding, but rather because it is an indispensable guideline to
the latter, in order to engage in such experience.
But as to that which is the true business of metaphysics, namely to
find, for the concept of what lies beyond the realm of possible experience, and for the extension of knowledge by means of such a concept,
a touchstone for whether they are indeed real, that is something the
400What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
bold metaphysician might well-nigh despair of, if he does but understand the demand that is made upon him. For if he advances beyond his
concept, whereby he can only think objects, but cannot confirm them
by any possible experience, and if that thought is but possible, which he
arrives at by so framing it that he does not contradict himself therein;
then whatever the objects he may please to think up, he is sure that
he cannot run into any experience that refutes him, since he will have
thought up an object, e.g., a spirit, of precisely such a description that it
absolutely cannot be an object of experience. For that not a single experience confirms this idea of his, cannot injure him in the least, since he
wanted to think a thing according to determinations that put it beyond
all bounds of experience. Thus such concepts can be quite empty, and
the propositions assuming objects thereof to be real can therefore be 20: 319
utterly erroneous, and yet there is no touchstone available to discover
this error.
Of the very concept of the super-sensible, in which reason takes so
much interest, that that is why metaphysics, at least as an enterprise,
exists at all, has always existed, and will continue to exist hereafter –
of this concept, for the same reason, it cannot be directly determined,
on theoretical lines, by any touchstone, whether it possesses objective
reality, or is mere fabrication. For though contradiction is not to be
found therein, there is no direct proof or refutation by any test that we
might apply to it, whether everything that is and can be might not also
be object of possible experience, and whether the concept of the supersensible as such might not therefore be wholly empty, and the supposed
progression from the sensible to the super-sensible far removed, in that
case, from deserving to be considered real.
But before metaphysics had yet reached the point of making this
distinction, it had intermingled Ideas, which can only have the supersensible as their object, with a priori concepts, to which objects of experience are appropriate, in that it simply never occurred to it that the
origin of these Ideas could be different from that of other pure a priori
concepts; whence it has then come about – a thing particularly notable
in the history of the aberrations of human reason – that since the latter feels itself capable of acquiring a large range of cognitions a priori
concerning things of Nature, and in general concerning that which can
be object of possible experience (not merely in natural science, but also
in mathematics), and has demonstrated the reality of these advances in
practice, it is quite unable to foresee why it cannot progress still further
with its a priori concepts, namely to penetrate successfully to things or
properties thereof which do not belong to objects of experience. It was
necessarily bound to take the concepts from both fields for concepts of
the same kind, because in their origin they are to this extent really alike,
that both are grounded a priori in our faculty of cognition, are not created
401What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
from experience, and thus seem to be entitled to an equal expectation of
a real domain and extension thereof.
However, another strange phenomenon was bound eventually to
startle reason, as it slumbered on the pillow of its supposed knowledge,
extended by Ideas beyond all bounds of possible experience, and that is
20: 320 the discovery that although the a priori propositions confined to such
experience are not only in good agreement, but even form a system of
a priori knowledge of Nature, those, on the other hand, which overstep
the bounds of experience, though they do appear to be of similar origin,
come into conflict and mutual attrition, partly among themselves, and
partly with those that refer to natural knowledge; whereby they seem,
however, to rob reason, in the theoretical field, of all confidence, and to
promote an unmitigated skepticism.
Now for this misfortune there is no remedy save that of subjecting
pure reason itself, i.e., the faculty of knowing anything at all a priori,
to an exact and thorough critique; and this in such a way as to assume
the possibility of a real extension of knowledge thereby in regard to the
sensible, and the same for the super-sensible, or if this should not be
possible here, to look into a restriction of reason in that respect; and so
far as the super-sensible is concerned, as the purpose of metaphysics, to
assure to the latter the domain that it is capable of, not by direct proofs,
which have so often been found deceptive, but by deduction of the title of
reason to determinations a priori. Mathematics and natural science, so far
as they contain pure rational knowledge, require no critique of human
reason as such. For the touchstone of the truth of their propositions
lies in themselves, since their concepts go only so far as the objects
corresponding thereto can be given; whereas in metaphysics they are
put to a use which is supposed to overstep these limits and to extend to
objects which cannot be given at all, or at least not in the degree that the
intended use of the concept calls for, i.e., that which is appropriate to it.
402What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
Treatise 20: 321
Metaphysics is quite especially distinguished among all other sciences,
in that it is the only one that can be set forth in full completeness; so that
nothing remains for posterity to add, or enlarge upon in regard to its
content – indeed if the absolute whole does not systematically emerge
at once from the idea of it, the concept of it may be deemed incorrectly
framed. The cause of this is that its possibility presupposes a critique
of the entire faculty of pure reason, where what the latter can achieve
a priori in regard to objects of possible experience, or what comes to the
same (as will be shown in the sequel), what it can achieve in regard to
the a priori principles of the possibility of an experience as such, and thus
for knowledge of the sensible, can be completely exhausted; though what
that critique, impelled merely by the nature of pure reason, perhaps only
asks, but perhaps may also know, in regard to the super-sensible, can and
should be exactly stated by the very constitution and unity of this pure
faculty of knowledge. From this, and from the fact that through the idea
of a metaphysic it is at once determined a priori what can and should
be open to encounter within it, and what constitutes its whole possible
content, it now becomes possible to judge how the knowledge employed
in it is related to the whole, and how the real possession at one time, or in
one nation, is related to that in every other, and likewise to the want of the
knowledge that is sought therein; and since, in regard to the requirement
of pure reason, there can be no national difference, we may judge by a
sure yardstick from the example of what has occurred, miscarried, or
succeeded in one people, at the same time the defectiveness or progress
of the science as such at every time and in every people; so that the
problem assigned can be resolved as a question about human reason in
general.
It is therefore simply the poverty of this science, and the narrowness of the limits that enclose it, which make it possible to set it forth
completely in a short outline, and yet sufficiently to judge every true possession therein. But on the other hand, the comparatively large variety of 20: 322
consequences, from few principles, that the critique of pure reason leads
to, does make very much harder the attempt to set it forth completely,
nonetheless, in so small a compass as the Royal Academy requires; for by
inquiry conducted in piecemeal fashion nothing therein is sorted out –
the agreement of every proposition to the whole of the pure employment
of reason is the only thing which can provide a guarantee of the reality
of its advances. A brevity that is fruitful, but yet does not degenerate
into obscurity, will therefore demand almost more attentive care in the
discussion to follow, than the difficulty of doing justice to the task that
is now to be discharged.

First Section
On the General Task of the Reason that subjects itself to a Critique
This is contained in the question: How are synthetic a priori judgments
possible?44
Judgments are analytic, we may say, if their predicate merely presents
clearly (explicite) what was thought, albeit obscurely (implicite), in the
concept of the subject; e.g., any body is extended. If we wanted to call such
judgments identical, we should merely cause confusion; for judgments
of that sort contribute nothing to the clarity of the concept which all
judging must yet aim at, and are therefore called empty; e.g., any body
is a bodily (or in other words a material) entity. Analytical judgments are
indeed founded upon identity, and can be resolved into it, but they are
not identical, for they need to be dissected and thereby serve to elucidate
the concept; whereas by identical judgments, on the other hand, idem per
idem,a nothing whatever would be elucidated.
Synthetic judgments are those which by means of their predicate go
beyond the concept of the subject, in that the former contains something
that was not thought at all in the concept of the latter, e.g., all bodies
are heavy. Now here we are by no means asking whether the predicate
20: 323 is always connected with the concept of the subject or not; we say merely
that in this concept it is not concurrently thought whether the predicate
must necessarily be appended to it. Thus, for example, the proposition:
Any three-sided figure has three angles ( figura trilatera est triangula), is
a synthetic proposition. For although, if I think three straight lines as
enclosing a space, it is impossible that three angles should not simultaneously be formed thereby, I still, in this concept of the three-sided,
by no means think the inclination of these sides to one another, i.e., the
concept of the angle is not truly thought in it.
All analytical judgments are judgments a priori, and hence are valid
with strict universality and absolute necessity, because they are founded
entirely upon the principle of contradiction. But synthetic judgments
can also be judgments of experience, which do indeed tell us how certain
things are constituted, but never that they necessarily must be so, and
cannot be constituted otherwise: e.g., all bodies are heavy; for in this case
their universality is merely comparative: All bodies, so far as we know
of them, are heavy, which universality we might call the empirical, as
distinct from the rational, which as known a priori, is a strict universality.
Now if there were to be synthetic propositions a priori, they would not
rest upon the principle of contradiction, and in regard to them there
would thus arise the aforementioned question, never before proposed in
its universality, let alone resolved: How are synthetic a priori propositions
a the same by the same
404What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
possible? But that there actually are such propositions, and that reason
does not serve merely to enlarge analytically on concepts already acquired (a very necessary enterprise, if it is first to get a good understanding of itself ), but rather is actually capable of synthetically extending its
stock a priori, and that metaphysics, indeed, as to the means it employs,
relies on the former, but in respect of its aim rests entirely on the latter –
all this will be amply shown as the present discussion proceeds. But since
the advances which metaphysics professes to have made might still be
doubted, as to whether they are real or not, pure mathematics still stands,
like a colossus, to prove the reality of knowledge extended solely by pure
reason, despite the attacks of the boldest doubter; and though itself in no
need whatever of any critique of the pure faculty of reason, in order to
confirm the rectitude of its claims, being warranted, rather, by the very
fact of itself, it provides, nonetheless, a firm example to demonstrate at
least the reality of the problem so exceedingly necessary for metaphysics:
How are synthetic a priori propositions possible?
It was proof more than anything else of the philosophical spirit of 20: 324
Plato,45 an accomplished mathematician, that he could be thrown into
such astonishment at the greatness of pure reason, in touching the understanding with so many grand and unexpected principles in geometry,
that it swept him off into the wild idea of considering all these findings,
not as new acquisitions in our earthly life, but as a mere reawakening of
much earlier Ideas, which could be based upon nothing less than community with the divine understanding. A mere mathematician might well
have been rejoiced by these products of his reason to the point, perhaps,
of sacrificing a hecatomb, but their possibility would not have thrown
him into astonishment, because he was brooding merely upon his object,
and had no occasion to consider and marvel also at the subject, so far as
it is capable of such deep knowledge thereof. A mere philosopher like
Aristotle, on the other hand, would have paid too little heed to the vast
difference between the pure faculty of reason, so far as it extends itself
from within, and that which, guided by empirical principles, progresses
to the more general by inference; and hence would also not have felt such
an astonishment, but, in that he regarded metaphysics merely as a physics
ascending to higher levels, would have found nothing strange or incomprehensible in its pretensions, extending even to the super-sensible, for
which the key should be even so hard to find as in fact it is.
Second Section
Definition of the Task in hand, with regard to the Cognitive Faculties
which constitute Pure Reason in Ourselves.
The foregoing task can be resolved in no other way but this: that we
consider it first in relation to the faculties in man, whereby he is capable
405What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
of extending his knowledge a priori, and which constitute that in him
which can be called specifically his pure reason. For if, by a pure reason
20: 325 of a being in general, we understand the power of knowing things independently of experience, and thus of sense-representations, we have
thereby determined not at all in what way generally such a knowledge
may be possible in him (e.g., in God, or another higher spirit), and the
problem is thus undefined.
As to man, however, such a knowledge in him consists of concept
and intuition. Each of these two is representation, indeed, but not yet
knowledge. To entertain something through concepts, i.e., in general,
is to think, and the power to think, understanding. The immediate representation of the individual is intuition. Knowledge through concepts
is called discursive, that in intuition, intuitive; for a cognition we in fact
require both combined together, but it is called after that to which I
particularly attend on each occasion, as the determining ground thereof.
That both can be either empirical or pure modes of representation pertains to the specific constitution of the human faculty of cognition, which
we shall soon examine more closely. By the intuition that accords with a
concept the object is given; without that it is merely thought. By this mere
intuition without concept the object is given, indeed, but not thought; by
the concept without corresponding intuition it is thought but not given;
thus in both cases it is not known. If, to a concept, the corresponding
intuition can be supplied a priori, we say that this concept is constructed;
if it is merely an empirical intuition, it is called simply an instance of the
concept; the act of appending the intuition to the concept is called in
both cases presentation (exhibitio) of the object, without which (whether
it occurs mediately or immediately) there can be no knowledge whatever.
The possibility 46 of a thought or concept rests on the principle of contradiction, e.g., that of a thinking immaterial being (a spirit). The thing
of which even the mere thought is impossible (i.e. the concept is selfcontradictory), is itself impossible. But the thing of which the concept
is possible is not on that account a possible thing. The first possibility
may be called logical, the second, real possibility; the proof of the latter
is the proof of the objective reality of the concept, which we are entitled
to demand at any time. But it can never be furnished otherwise than by
presentation of the object corresponding to the concept; for otherwise
20: 326 it always remains a mere thought, of which, until it is displayed in an
example, it always remains uncertain whether any object corresponds
to it, or whether it be empty, i.e., whether it may serve in any way for
knowledge.
A certain author wishes to rebut this requirement by a case which in
fact is the only one of its kind, namely the concept of a necessary being,
of whose existence we might be certain, since the ultimate cause, at least,
must be an absolutely necessary being, and hence the objective reality of
406What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
this concept can be proved without having to provide an intuition corresponding to it in any example. But the concept of a necessary being is still
by no means the concept of a thing in any way determined. For existence
is not a determination of any thing, and which inner predicates attach to
a thing, on the ground that we assume it to be a thing independent in its
existence, can absolutely not be known from its mere existence, whether
it be assumed as necessary or as not necessary.
No. II
The Second Stage of Metaphysics
Its Standstill in the Skepticism of Pure Reason
Although a standstill cannot be called an advance, or really a stage accomplished either, still, if progress in a certain direction unavoidably
results in an equally large regression, the outcome of this is just the same
as if we had not stirred from the spot.
Space and time contain relationships of the conditioned to its conditions, e.g., the particular size of a space is only possible under a condition, namely, that another space encloses it; likewise a particular time,
in that it is represented as part of a still larger time, and that is the
situation with all given things, as appearances. But reason demands to
know the unconditioned, and therewith the totality of all conditions, for
otherwise it does not cease to question, just as if nothing had yet been
answered.
Now this by itself would not yet leave reason bewildered, for how
often do we not ask in vain about the why in the theory of Nature, and
yet have found the excuse of ignorance a valid one, since at least it is better 20: 327
than error. But reason becomes bewildered with itself, in that, guided
by the surest principles, it believes that it has found the unconditioned
on one side, and yet on other, equally assured principles, brings itself to
believe at the same time that it must be sought on the opposite side.
This antinomy 47 of reason not only throws it into an uncertainty of
mistrust towards the one as much as the other of these its claims, which
would still leave open the hope of a judgment deciding this way or that,
but casts it into a despair of reason in itself, to abandon all claim to
certainty, which we may call the state of dogmatic skepticism.
But such a struggle of reason with itself has this peculiarity, that reason
thinks of the conflict as a duel in which, if it takes the attack, it is certain
of defeating the opponent, but so far as it has to defend itself, is equally
certain of being defeated. In other words, it cannot so much depend on
proving its claim as on refuting that of the opponent – a thing by no
means certain, in that both might well be judging falsely, or even both
might well be right, if only they had first reached agreement about the
meaning of the question.
407What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
This antinomy divides the contestants into two classes, of which one
seeks the unconditioned in the compounding of what is similar, the other
in the manifold thereof, which may also be dissimiliar. The former is
mathematical, and proceeds from the parts of a similar quantity, by addition, to the absolute whole, or from the whole to the parts, of which
none is in turn a whole. The latter is dynamical and proceeds from the
consequences to the supreme synthetic ground, which is thus something
different, realiter, from the succession, either the supreme determining ground of the causality of a thing, or that of the existence of this
thing itself.
Now the opposites of the first class are, as said, of a double kind. The
one which proceeds thus from the parts to the whole: The world has a
beginning, and the one that says: It has no beginning, are both equally false;
and those which go from the consequences to the grounds, and then synthetically back again, though opposed to one another, can still both be
true, since a sequence can have several grounds, which yet are transcendentally different, in that the ground is an object either of sensibility or
of pure reason, whose representation cannot be given in empirical rep-
20: 328 resentation; e.g., everything is natural necessity, and hence there is no
freedom, to which there stands opposed the antithesis: there is freedom
and not everything is natural necessity, where a skeptical position thus
enters, which produces a standstill of reason.
For so far as the first are concerned, just as in logic two contrarily
opposed judgments can both be false, since the one says more than is
required for opposition, so the same can be true in metaphysics. Thus the
propositions that the world has no beginning, and that the world has a
beginning, contain neither more nor less than is required for opposition,
and one of the two would have to be true, the other false. But if I say that
it has no beginning, but has existed from all eternity, I am saying more
than is required for opposition. For in addition to what the world is not,
I go on to say what it is. Now the world, considered as an absolute whole,
is thought as a noumenon, and yet by its beginning or infinite duration
as phenomenon. If I now assert this intellectual totality of the world,
or if I ascribe limits to it qua noumenon, both statements are false. For
with the absolute totality of conditions in a sensory world, i.e., in time,
I contradict myself, whether I may fancy it given to me in a possible
intuition as infinite, or as having limits.
On the other hand, just as in logic subcontrary judgments opposed
to one another can both be true, since each says less than is required
for opposition, so in metaphysics two synthetic judgments, which refer
to objects of sense, but concern only the relationship of consequence to
grounds, can both be true, since the series of conditions is regarded in
one of two different ways, namely as object of sensibility or object of
mere reason. For the conditioned consequences are given in time, but
408What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
the grounds or conditions are added in thought, and can be various. So if
I say: All events in the world of sense come about through natural causes,
I am imputing conditions to them in the shape of phenomena. If the opponent says: Not everything occurs from purely natural causes (causa
phaenomenon), the first statement would have to be false. But if I say: Not
everything occurs from purely natural causes, for it may also occur at the
same time from super-sensible grounds (causa noumenon), I am then saying less than is required to form an antithesis to the totality of conditions
in the world of sense, for I am assuming a cause that is confined, not to
conditions of that kind, but to those of sensory representation, and so am
not contradicting conditions of the latter type; for I am thinking merely 20: 329
of the intelligible, whose thought is already present in the concept of a
mundus phaenomenon in which everything is conditioned, so that reason
is not here contesting the totality of conditions.
This skeptical standstill, which contains no skepticism, i.e., no renunciation of certainty in the extension of our rational knowledge beyond
the limits of possible experience, is now very beneficial; for without it
we should have either had to abandon man’s greatest concern, which
metaphysics treats as its ultimate goal, and confine our use of reason
merely to the sensible, or been compelled, as has happened for so long,
to fob off the enquirer with untenable pretensions to insight: had there
been no intervention from the critique of pure reason, which by dividing the legislature of metaphysics into two chambers has redressed both
the despotism of empiricism and the anarchical mischief of unbridled
philodoxy.
No. III
Marginal Notes
The unconditioned possibility of a thing, and the impossibility of its
nonexistence, are alike transcendent notions, which cannot be thought
at all, since without any condition we have grounds neither to posit anything, nor to abolish it. So the proposition that a thing exists with absolute
contingency, or absolute necessity, has in both cases never any ground at
all. The disjunctive proposition therefore has no object. It’s as if I said:
Any given thing is either X or non-X, and knew nothing at all of this X.
All the world has some sort of metaphysic as the aim of reason, and
along with morality, this is what philosophy proper consists of.
The concepts of necessity and contingency do not seem to refer to
substance. Nor do we ask about the cause of the existence of a substance,
since it is that which always was and must remain, and on which, as
a substrate, the mutable grounds its relationships. At the concept of a
409What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
substance, the concept of cause leaves off. It is itself cause, but not effect.
20: 330 And how should anything be cause of a substance outside it, so that
the former also continued its power through the latter? For then the
consequences of the latter would merely be effects of the former, and
the latter would thus itself be no ultimate subject.
The proposition: Everything contingent has a cause, should run thus:
Everything, that can exist only in conditioned fashion, has a cause.
Likewise the necessity of the ens originariuma is nothing but the notion of its unconditioned existence. – But necessity means more, namely
that we may also know, and from its very concept, that it exists.
The need of reason, to ascend from the conditioned to the unconditioned, also pertains to the concepts themselves. For all things contain
reality, and indeed a degree thereof. This is always regarded as only
conditionally possible, namely insofar as I presuppose a concept of the
realissimum, of which the latter contains only the limitation: Everything
conditioned is contingent, and conversely.
The primal being, as the highest being (realissimum), can or [must] be
thought as a being that contains all reality as a determination in itself.
This is not actual for us, since we do not know all reality in a pure sense, or
at least cannot perceive that with all its diversity it may be encountered in
one being alone. We shall thus assume it to be ens realissimum as ground,
and by this it can be represented as a being that is wholly unknowable to
us in regard to what it contains.
There is a particular illusion in this, that since in transcendental theology we demand to know the unconditionally existing object, since that
alone can be necessary, we first of all lay down the unconditioned con-
20: 331 cept of an object, consisting in the fact that all concepts of limited objects
are derived as such, i.e., by attached negations or defectus, and only the
concept of the realissimum, that is, of the being in which all predicates
are real, is conceptus logice originariusb (unconditioned). This is taken for
a proof that only an ens realissimum can be necessary, or conversely, that
the absolutely necessary is the ens realissimum.
We want to avoid the proof that [an] ens realissimum necessarily exists, and would sooner prove that if such a being exists, it would have to
be a realissimum. (So one would now have to prove that one among all
that exists, exists with absolute necessity, and that can certainly be done.)
But the proof says no more than that we have no concept whatever of
a primal being
b logically prime concept
410What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
what pertains to a necessary being, as such, in the way of properties, save
that it exists unconditionally in respect of its existence. But what that
involves, we know not. Among our concepts of things is the logically unconditioned but yet thoroughly determined notion of the ens realissimum.
So if we could also assume for this concept an object that corresponded
to it, it would be the ens realissimum. But we are not entitled to assume
for our mere concept an object of this kind.
On the hypothesis that something exists, it follows also that something
necessarily exists, but yet absolutely and without any condition it cannot
be known that something necessarily exists, be the concept of a thing, in
respect of its inner predicates, assumed as it may, and it can be proved
that this is utterly impossible. I have thus concluded to the concept of a
being, of whose possibility nobody can form a concept.
But why do I conclude to the unconditioned? Because this is supposed
to contain the supreme ground of the conditioned. The conclusion is
therefore: (1) If something exists, there is also something unconditioned.
(2) What exists unconditionally, exists as absolutely necessary being. The
latter is no necessary inference, for the unconditioned can be necessary
for a series, though itself, and the series, may always be contingent. This
latter is not a predicate of things (as, for example, whether they are
conditioned or unconditioned), but pertains to the existence of things,
with all their predicates, whether they are in fact necessary in themselves
or not. It is thus a mere relationship of the object to our concept.
Any existential proposition is synthetic, and so too is the proposition
that God exists. Were it to be analytic, the existence of God would have
to be deducible from the mere concept of such a possible being. Now
this has been attempted in two ways: (1) In the concept of the most real 20: 332
being of all, its existence is implied, for such existence is reality. (2) In
the concept of a necessarily existing being is implied the concept of the
highest reality, as the sole way in which the absolute necessity of a thing
(which must be assumed, if anything exists), can be thought. Now should
a necessary being already include in its concept the highest reality, but the
latter (as No. 1 says) not include the concept of an absolute necessity,
so that the concepts cannot be reciprocated, then the concept of the
realissimum would be conceptus latior a than the concept of necessarium,
i.e. other things besides the realissimum could be entia necessaria b But
now this proof is effected precisely through the supposition that the ens
necessarium can only be thought in a single way, etc.
The p??t ˜ o? ?e?d ˜ o? c actually lies in this, that the necessarium contains in its concept the existence, consequently of a thing, as omnimoda
a wider concept
b necessary beings
c cart before the horse
411What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
determinatio,a so that this omnimoda determinatio can be derived (not
merely inferred) from its concept, which is false, since it is proved only
that if it is to be derivable from a concept, this must be the concept of
the realissimum (which alone is a concept that contains thoroughgoing
determinacy).
So the position is, that if we were to be able to perceive the existence
of a necessarium, as such, we would have to be able to derive the existence
of a thing from some concept, i.e., the omnimoda determinatio. But this is
the concept of a realissimum. So we would have to be able to derive the
existence of a necessarium from the concept of the realissimum, which is
false. We cannot say that a being has those properties, without which I
would not know its existence, as necessary, from concepts, even if those
properties are assumed, not as constitutive products of the first concept,
but merely as conditio sine qua non.b
It pertains to the principle of the knowledge that is a priori synthetic,
that compounding is the only a priori which, if it occurs according to space
and time at all, must be done by us. For experience, however, knowledge
contains the schematism, either the real schematism (transcendental),
or the schematism by analogy (symbolic). The objective reality of the
categories is theoretical, that of the Idea is only practical. – Nature and

a what is above us is nothing to us.
413What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
Now the harmony of happiness in the world with the worthiness
to be happy (if such a harmony is constantly to occur) is a contingent
consequence of events in the world.
So this harmony, if it exists or is postulated must also have a cause
(and one different from all causes in the world).
This cause must lie in the world and in the beings that reside there,
for the law of causality applies only to sensory beings. But because
this harmony, in comparison with its principle of perfection, cannot
be known by us to be appropriate for all eternity, or even for the
whole world, it is a matter of belief. Or rather the knowledge of its
possibility belongs to the intelligible ground, namely of the existence
both of rational and of free beings, whose causes of existence by the
catego. . .
The good will must arise from itself, but is no phenomenon, since it
relates to maxims and not to actions which take place in the world. The
conjunction of the two is an occurrence. One may say of it that God
is the originator of the highest sum of morality, and so far as it is not
perfect, of the greatest harmony with happiness.
Harmony can be possible in that God might be the cause of morality and also of happiness in proportion, but that is not thinkable since
it would be mechanism and not freedom: Man is himself regarded as
cause of his actions that take place in the world, but why he has acted
thus rather than otherwise, and this from freedom, is incomprehensible to himself, since it is freedom. Of the good or bad will as the
world of maxims we say only secundum analogiam that God gives it
and that he improves or hardens the heart. We know only the actions and also the phenomenon of their adoption into our maxims;
the intelligible character on which they are founded, we are unable to
examine.
20: 337 The reality of the concept of this harmony has its ground in pure
practical reason, to work towards a supreme good, and thus also to think
it in an idea as possible through our powers.
The subjective of intuition must determine this constitution it has,
since otherwise it could not be a priori and necessary. So too with the
subjective of concepts, i.e. of the method of framing a concept thereof
in general. Without that there would also be no necessity.
To construct concepts, i.e. to give them a priori in intuition, space
and time are required; for experience, in addition to a priori concepts,
we also need that of existence (realitas) for perception (the empirical).
But to construct always requires, for time, the describing of a line whose
414What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
parts are nevertheless simultaneous, and for the line a time whose parts
are successive.
No more than it is possible to infer from the concept of a being to its
necessity, is it possible to infer from its necessity to the concept that one
has to frame of it; for modality and content of a thing have nothing in
common with each other.
The first of these three stages contains the advances in metaphysics
in two of its divisions, theory of being and general theory of Nature.
Ontology and rational physics. In the latter, objects are regarded as
given in experience, save that what must be thought of them a priori as
objects either of outer or inner sense represents the general theory of
body and soul together, as general theory of Nature. Physica rationalis
and Psychologia rationalis. General physics belongs to ontology as totality
of the a priori conditions under which objective reality can be given to 20: 338
its concepts of the latter: yet in such a way that no experiential theory of
bodily and thinking Nature, physica and psychologia empirica, must appear
therein.
To this formal theory of Nature there also belongs discussion of (1)
whether the principle of the ideality of space goes so far that one may
also do wholly without the existence of outer objects of the senses, and
(2) whether that of the ideality of time goes so far that the inner sense,
distinct from consciousness, and thus the empirical self, might be abolished. The rational self gives no knowledge, but only the synthesis of the
manifold of intuition as such, for the possibility of a cognition.
Whether there is an outer sense that is distinct from the consciousness
of our representations. Whether there is an inner sense that is distinct
from the consciousness of inner representations.
If the first were not so, the object (my mere representation) would
be simply in myself. Now since I must be able to become aware of my
entire state, I would locate everything external simply in time. Space as
something whose parts are successive. If I knew myself as I am, not as I
appear to myself, my change would create a contradiction in me. I would
never be the same person. The identity of the self would be abolished.
The logical subject is not an object of knowledge for itself, but the
physical self certainly is, to itself, and that by the categories, as modes of
compounding of the manifold of inner (empirical) intuition, so far as it
(the compounding) is possible a priori.

The upshot of the first stage is that the human power of theoretical
cognition could not extend beyond the objects of the senses or the bounds
20: 339 of possible experience, and these objects are not things in themselves,
but merely their appearances.

Intuition [=] Immediate Representation
(1) How are synthetic propositions possible as such? In that over and
above my concept I take something as a mark from the intuition underlying it, and combine it with this concept.
Empirical//synthetic judgments are those in which the subject is a
concept to which an empirical intuition corresponds; a priori//synthetic
those to whose subject a priori intuition corresponds. Hence there are
no synthetic propositions (though metaphysics is full of them) without
there being pure intuitions a priori.
(2) What are pure intuitions? Forms of sensibility of the outer and
inner sense, space and time, which precede everything empirical.
(3) How is it possible that we can know synthetically a priori the
properties of things in space and time? No otherwise than by our thinking
this form, not as pertaining to objects, but as attaching subjectively to
20: 340 the representing being; for then there can be a priori determination, not
of what attaches as such to objects that depend on the conditions of space
and time, but of how they must necessarily appear to the subject.
(4) By mere concepts we can produce no synthetic a priori propositions. For supposing space and time were confusedly represented features
of things, then perception of their properties would have only empirical
validity, and necessity would depart from them, since these properties
would be derived synthetically, and indeed a posteriori, i.e. empirically,
from the objects by perception.

(5) Are mere intuitions, pure or empirical, adequate for synthetic
knowledge without concepts a priori? No, without synthesis a priori, and
the concept of compounding from the manifold of this intuition, no
judgment a priori would be possible. For the unity of consciousness that
is required for every judgment, and indeed the unity of consciousness
in a synthesis a priori, becomes required for such a judgment, and these
concepts are the categories, which first give knowledge with intuitions and
not without them, and hence do not give it as mere categories.
(6) How far can these a priori principles extend? Merely to objects in
appearance, and thus only to objects of the senses, and that only as they
appear to us.
(7) How is it possible that a subject should be conscious of itself as
mere appearance, and in an immediate way, and yet at the same time be
aware of itself as thing-in-itself? The first by empirical apperception, the
second by pure apperception.
Of a Philosophizing History of Philosophy
All historical knowledge is empirical, and hence knowledge of things as
they are; not that they necessarily have to be that way. Rational knowledge presents them according to their necessity. Thus a historical presentation of philosophy recounts how philosophizing has been done
hitherto, and in what order. But philosophizing is a gradual development of human reason, and this cannot have set forth, or even have
begun, upon the empirical path, and that by mere concepts. There must
have been a need of reason (theoretical or practical) which obliged it to
ascend from its judgments about things to the grounds thereof, up to the
first, initially through common reason, e.g., from the world-bodies and
their motion. But purposes were also encountered: and finally, since it 20: 341
was noticed that rational grounds can be sought concerning all things,
a start was made with enumerating the concepts of reason (or those of
the understanding) beforehand, and with analyzing thinking in general,
without any object. The former was done by Aristotle, the latter even
earlier by the logicians.
A philosophical history of philosophy is itself possible, not historically
or empirically, but rationally, i.e., a priori. For although it establishes facts
of reason, it does not borrow them from historical narrative, but draws
them from the nature of human reason, as philosophical archaeology.
What have the thinkers among men been able to reason out concerning
the origin, the goal, and the end of things in the world? Was it the
purposiveness in the world, or merely the chain of causes and effects, or
was it the purpose of mankind from which they began?

On the Incapacity of Men to Communicate Completely
with One Another
In things that can be presented, this goes on well; far less so in feelings;
and least of all in those sensations which follow upon ideas. Aristippus
counted purely on the latter as the absolutely real. But communication
is doubtful – deficiencies of language – morality contains the highest
communicability of feelings, but then it is most successful when it is
most abstract, and ultimately has as its determining ground only the
mere feeling of our receptivity to morality.
The Ideas of God and a future state do not acquire objective theoretical reality on moral grounds, but only the practical reality, so to act as

Idealism. Time can be determinately thought only in the apprehension
of space (and in comprehension for simultaneity). Now should nothing
as outwardly given underlie the intuition of space, then the represen-
20: 342 tation of something external would be merely a thought, and so really given to the mind by nothing external. Thus it would at least be
possible to think of one’s inner representations as in space, which is
contradictory.
Whether a history of philosophy might be written mathematically;

That there is no probability in regard to the super-sensible, but a

universally valid, and yet is thought in relation to the subject, namely to
accept something as true in relation to the maxims of the will, which are
necessary, and yet which would otherwise be an empty will without object.
Whether a schema could be drawn up a priori for the history of philosophy, with which, from the extant information, the epochs and opinions
of the philosophers so coincide, that it is as though they had had this
very schema themselves before their eyes, and had progressed by way of
it in knowledge of the subject.
418What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
Yes! if, that is, the idea of a metaphysic inevitably presents itself to
human reason, and the latter feels a need to develop it, though this
science lies wholly prefigured in the soul, albeit only in embryo.
One cannot write a history of the thing that has not happened, and for 20: 343
which nothing has ever been provided as preparation and raw materials.
Whether the history of philosophy might itself be a part of philosophy,
or would have to be part of the history of learning as such.
Whatever advances philosophy may have made, the history thereof is
nevertheless distinct from philosophy itself, or the latter must be a mere
ideal of a source, lying in human reason, of the philosophy of pure reason,
whose development also has its rule in human nature. F ¨ ulleborn.48
A history of philosophy is of such a special kind, that nothing can be
told therein of what has happened, without knowing beforehand what
should have happened, and also what can happen. Whether this has
been investigated beforehand or whether it has been reasoned out haphazardly. For it is the history, not of the opinions which have chanced to
arise here or there, but of reason developing itself from concepts. We do
not want to know what has been reasoned out, but what has been surveyed by reasoning through mere concepts. Philosophy is to be viewed
here as a sort of rational genius, from which we demand to know what
it should have taught, and whether it has furnished this. To get to the
bottom of this, we have to inquire what and why one interest, and one so
great, has hitherto been taken in metaphysics. We shall find that it is not
the analysis of concepts and judgments such as can be applied to objects
of the senses, but the super-sensible, especially insofar as practical Ideas
are founded upon it.
Task of the Academy
(A) Prolegomena
1. What sort of knowledge should the thing subsequently called
metaphysics have been from the earliest times until now: a science of
the objects of reason, or a science of reason itself, and of its power to
arrive at knowledge of those objects?
2. What has metaphysics been from the earliest times, up to and 20: 344
including Leibniz and Wolf, especially in Germany?
3. What is it now: has it lately made advances in Germany?
4. If so, what will be its fate hereafter, a further progress, or a regression, or the status of a depot which, without being capable of increase or
diminution, must be preserved for the use of reason (the negative use)?
419What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
The answers to the first two questions serve as Prolegomena to introduce the problem; that to the third alone as a discussion designed to
solve it; the answer to the fourth is a supplement or scholium to the
discussion.
1. Concept of metaphysics, what we mean by it, without yet defining
completely what it ought to be.
For all science from concepts a priori we have a metaphysics. It does
not cover all knowledge of things by reason, for it does not include
mathematics, though it judges concerning the possibility of the latter.
1. Critique. 2. System. 3. Comparison with that at the time
of Leibniz and Wolf in Germany.
It is a matter of whether we have cognitions a priori, and these not
merely elucidatory, but also enlarging upon the given concept. The latter
contain concepts a priori of objects.
a. If any concept of the super-sensible should be accepted, it is a question of what we should found its reality upon. Not on a knowledge given
thereby, for that is not possible of the super-sensible; so only through
the practical, and that as a ground thereof which must be determinant,
not according to laws of nature, but actually against them.
It seems difficult to present so great a diversity as that embraced by
20: 345 metaphysics, within a small compass, and yet with completeness in respect of its sources; but in fact it is made easy by the organic combination
of all powers of knowledge under the supreme government of reason,
since one may start from many points and yet complete the whole circle
according to a principle, so that the only difficulty is to choose where we
want to set out from. It seems to me most advisable to begin with what
first engendered interest in founding a metaphysics (freedom, so far as it
is made known through moral laws), since the solution of the difficulty
associated with that occasions a complete anatomy of our cognitive faculty, and thus one might run through the whole circle, for here there is
given a concept of the super-sensible with its reality (albeit merely of the
practical kind).
All authors have labored to realize the three super-sensible entities.
To which morality partly moved them, and partly could alone provide a
determinate concept.
That man (has a?t e? ’ o?s?a? ´ – self-command),49 is superior to all
obstacles in the way of his good will, cannot be immediately maintained
with certainty. The moral law ordains this conquest, so it must be possible. Predeterminism. Since physical necessity here pertains to time, the
causality of the free will must not be tied to the temporal condition, although man as a being of Nature is tied thereto. From this it follows that
man distinguishes himself as appearance from himself as noumenon.
420What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
In all our knowledge, what we call an a priori cognition is not only the
noblest, because – independent of restrictive conditions of experience –
it extends over more objects than the empirical cognition; as a necessary cognition it itself also confers upon the empirical judgments whose
possibility it underlies that validity which is independent of subjective
conditions, viz., that these judgments are truly valid of the object, and
are cognitions. But these cognitions a priori contain at the same time a
secret which a critique of pure reason has as a necessary preliminary task,
prior to metaphysics, namely to render intelligible also the possibility of
a priori knowledge. If there are a priori concepts, a deduction of them 20: 346
and their validity (not their production), and whether there are a priori
propositions . . .
Knowledge a priori is independent of experience, yet the representations therein can be empirical, although the judgment is analytic. If
it is synthetic, however, the concept under which something empirical,
e.g., some event, is subsumed, must be an a priori concept; for empirical
and diverse concepts can be synthetically bound no otherwise than by
experience. A priori knowledge is even the ground of the possibility of
experience, or at least of that which constitutes the objective unity in
judgments. For cognitions the requisite elements thereof are concepts
and intuition, the latter either as likewise empirical or as pure intuition.
Thinking and intuiting: without the latter there is no object, and without
the former we do not think and do not know the object.
That opposition,50 considered according to pure rational concepts,
i.e., principles of freedom, is a conflict of the internally determining
grounds of man’s choice, to take up into his maxims either the moral or
the pathological motive of actions; which (if it is allowable to personify
the mere capacity of man allegorically) can be represented as the conflict
of the good spirit with a bad one. For natural drives are in themselves
innocent, and between them and the moral law there is really no conflict:
but to make it one’s maxim to follow the law, independent of these drives,
and even against them, is an act of freedom in conflict with these drives, to
whose reality experience attests in human actions, though its possibility 20: 347
cannot be grasped; which is why the phenomenon is then allegorized on
the analogy of two independent principles dwelling in man, that are at
war with one another. But to distinguish the two of them, everyone has
the criterion at hand: If the representation of the law precedes the feeling
of pleasure or displeasure in an action, the latter is moral; if the other
way round, it is pathological. But to adopt the latter unconditionally into
one’s maxims is a principle of evil.
If, in the maxim, the representation of the law precedes, and the feeling
(of pleasure or displeasure at the object of choice) immediately follows
421What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
it, then this feeling is morally intellectual and the good principle rules
in man. If it is the other way round, and the feeling of pleasure or displeasure at the object precedes the law, then the feeling is pathological
(sensuous), and the bad principle rules in man, for to subordinate the
maxim unconditionally (in respect of the law) to the motives of sensibility (of the flesh) is always bad. Sensibility (of the flesh) is not, indeed,
what the good principle has to combat, for it is innocent; rather, the bad
principle in us is the propensity, which is free, to take one’s maxim according to these urges of sensibility. Yet the flesh is named as the enemy
which wars against the spirit, because it does mediately produce actions
contrary to law, if and in that man adopts it into his maxim. But to explain the possibility of such maxims, and in general how actions arise
from free choice, belongs among the problems which utterly transcend
human insight.
If we compare this with the metaphysics of Leibniz and Wolf, the lat-
20: 348 ter, since it was wholly theoretico-dogmatic and devoid of any critique of
pure reason, has no merit whatever in regard to this stage; unless it were
to consist in this, that it was able, far more methodically than heretofore,
to give a veneer of speculative insight to what the moral principles of
reason of the common understanding of mankind had already long since
been recommending men to believe and accept, and to secure a hearing
for it as to form (system) through the seeming connection in a scientific
whole; whereby the workers in this field were at least constrained to
thoroughness in their explanations, proofs, and arrangement.
A necessary being is one from whose concept his existence can be
derived (which by No. 1 is not feasible). So if I still have no concept of
such a being, I cannot know his existence a priori either: for existence,
even though it is thought with absolute necessity, is mere modality and
gives no concept of the thing that exists. However, then, I might wish
to fashion any concept whatsoever of a thing, I can still always abolish it
without contradiction. That is the . . .
To conclude from the contingency of the world, that is inferred from
change, to a necessary cause that is distinct from the world, will not do,
because its contingency is not thereby demonstrated. Only purposiveness
is allowable, for that is contingent; though it is not a property of things,
but one which we put into our concept of things in order to explain their
possibility to ourselves.
physico-theological argument
Of the unity of God, and that he is nameless, since his quality and
quantity are simply unique
422What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
Of the aggregate of realities, whence anthropomorphism. 20: 349
Of the representation of God by analogy.
In the transcendental concepts of reality, by a vitium subreptionis a of
thought, a concept is taken for a thing, the subjective of thinking for
the objective of what is thought, which latter cannot be met with in
thinking, but only in intuition, and here in an empirical intuition, since
it is the object of sensation in general which has to be given as example of
the concept, i.e., as object of the empirical intuition, which in regard to
the super-sensible is impossible. That whose concept contains a being,
in contrast to that whose concept contains a nonbeing, are modalities of
positing and abolishing to which we can give no objective meaning, since
they contain merely the subjective of thinking, namely the copula of the
predicate in relation to the subject, that is, the power of representation
in general. The transcendental vitium subreptionis. Leibniz’s completion
of Anselm’s argument:51
1. A most real being of all must exist (is a necessary being). For if it
did not exist, it would lack a reality, namely existence.
2. Conversely (through the back door), a necessary being, i.e., one
completely determined by its concept, must contain all reality. For if
it did not contain this, it would not be completely determined by its
concept, and so would not be necessary.
Now a necessary being exists, etc. This latter proposition is tautological, not an extension of knowledge. If the concept of a necessary being
were possible in virtue of its objective reality, i.e., in virtue of the determination of the object thereof, then it would be just as if one were to say: A
necessary being exists necessarily. The necessity of presupposing something in order to make an object comprehensible to oneself, e.g., matter,
because without it even space would not be an object of perception, is
taken for objective necessity, and here is realitas phaenomenon.
To take the concept for the thing, and the name of a thing for the 20: 350
concept.
The concept of a thing whose nonbeing is in itself contradictory, is
false – for nonbeing never contradicts itself (so if I call a thing necessary
in itself, I merely want to say: I have no concept of its nonbeing).
If I say: If something exists, then there also exists something else that
is absolutely necessary – since if nothing necessary existed, everything
would be contingent, and thus have another thing for its cause – the first
question that arises is whether this proposition is analytic or synthetic. In
a vice of pilfering
423What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany?
the first case the existence is contained in the concept, in the second it is
appended to the concept as a determination thereof. But both are false,
it being equally untrue that an existence is contained in the concept,
and that existence is something which is appended as determination of a
thing, over and above the concept thereof. For the concept of the thing is
not thereby extended – the thing itself is merely posited. So this question
contains merely a relation of things to thinking, and not to one another:
whether my thinking (positing or abolishing) is necessary or contingent.
So here concept is taken for thing, or rather the appearance of that
which. . .
A solid proof is valid only for the theoretico-dogmatic judgment, but
an argument can also hold for the practico-dogmatic. It then justifies a
free assent, not to be extorted by demonstration, but nonetheless assured
to this extent, that he who so considers it is sure in a practical sense of
not losing faith in it. Such an argument occurs in regard to those three
types of the super-sensible. In regard to these Ideas he may be in doubt
from a theoretical viewpoint, but cannot do without them, like beacons
to lighten his path.
Of anthropomorphism in the representation of the realissimum as
20: 351 aggregate. I then have no need to attribute to him understanding (albeit
unlike our own) and will; he is the ground, rather, of all that we cannot
think possible otherwise than through understanding, and so, too, of the
will.
If the feeling of pleasure precedes the law, it is sensuous; if the reverse,
it is intellectual, i.e. a moral feeling.
Of feeling that precedes the law, in comparison with that which follows
upon the representation thereof.
It is not the opposition of practical reason and sensibility, but of the
appearances of the former.
Of the representation of the sensible on the analogy with practical
reason.
424On a recently prominent tone of
superiority in philosophyTranslator’s introduction
Von einem neuerdings erhobenen vornehmen Ton in der Philosophie was first
published in May, 1796, in the Berlinische Monatsschrift 27, 387–426.
It was the opening shot in a controversy that later drew in a number
of other writers, and to which Kant was to contribute a second essay: Verk¨ undigung des nahen Abschlusses eines Traktats zum ewigen Frieden
in der Philosophie, which appeared in December of that year (BM 28,
485–504). In the meantime, a side-dispute had also broken out with
the mathematician J. A. H. Reimarus, over an allusion to Pythagorean
triangles in the first essay; it led Kant to pen a brief explanation: Ausgleichung eines auf Missverstand beruhenden mathematischen Streits, which
was printed in the August, 1796, number of the same journal. It had
nothing to do with the main issues in contention, and in some editions of Kant’s works has become detached from its context, to lead a
separate existence of its own. It has here been inserted in its proper
place.
Kant’s attack on fine airs in philosophy, and the “proclamation of
peace” that succeeded it, are primarily directed at the writings of
Johann Georg Schlosser, a retired administrator and gentleman-amateur
in philosophy, who happened also to be Goethe’s brother-in-law. Having
published, in 1795, a translation of Plato’s letters, Schlosser had joined
forces with another amateur Platonist, translator, and poetical light of
the Gottinger Dichterbund, Count Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg ¨
(1750–1819). Around them they had gathered a coterie of sympathizers, for whom the mystical elements in Platonism, as they understood it,
supplied a convenient cover for their own brand of reactionary Christian elitism. The pair knew little, if anything, of philosophy in the aca- ´
demic sense. Oblivious to the message of the Copernican revolution,
they preached a vague gospel of illumination by intuition and feeling,
accessible only to the favored few, and aired their views in a high-flown,
condescending style which Kant, for one, found sufficiently offensive to
deserve a satirical rebuke.
Schlosser – unwisely – replied to (and reprinted) Kant’s attack, in
his Schreiben an einen jungen Mann, der die Kantische Philosophie studieren
wollte of 1796. His advice to the studious young man was, of course,
don’t. But his attempt to explain Kantianism to his pupil was so riddled
427
with absurd misunderstandings,† that it brought down a second salvo,
the above-mentioned Proclamation of Perpetual Peace, in which Schlosser
was this time identified by name, and again put in his place. He did not
subside, however, and went on to produce a second letter, more foolish
than the first, which was thereupon ridiculed and abused in print by
such notables as Friedrich Schlegel, the critic, the poet Schiller, and
the twenty-two-year-old Schelling, and repudiated in private by Goethe
himself.
With such a phalanx having arisen in his defense, Kant saw no need
to return to the fray, and later spoke kindly enough of the ailing Schlosser
(who died in 1799). He even met and conversed amicably with Count
Stolberg when the latter visited his publisher, Nicolovius, in Konigsberg, ¨
though he declined an invitation to dinner. As is evident from the jocular tone of his two papers, Kant had never taken his opponents very
seriously, being well aware that they were lightweights, unworthy of his
powder and shot. It was only what they stood for, and their manner of
expressing it, that were sufficiently obnoxious to the cause of enlightenment to lead him to make an example of them. New arguments he did
not need. The dangers of dogmatism and Schw¨ armerei are a perennial
theme in all of Kant’s major writings, and had been fully set forth, for
example, in the Discipline of Pure Reason section of the first Critique.
The Schlosser affair was no more than a particularly blatant instance of
why such discipline was needed, to prevent quackery, and to curb those
excesses of idle speculation to which Kant’s countrymen have always
been somewhat prone.
With the waning of the controversy, interest in these two short papers
seems largely to have lapsed, for all but a few hardy specialists. In Englishspeaking bibliographies, the habit of mistranslating the word vornehm
as ‘gentle’, ‘noble’, ‘elevated’, or ‘dignified’ has obscured the fact that
Kant, so far from commending such a tone, is in actuality deriding and
condemning it.The point is fortunately not lost on Peter Fenves, the only
recent translator, though his general title, Raising the Tone of Philosophy
(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993), might suggest otherwise. In this work, the Kantian originals are prefixed to a version of
Jacques Derrida’s latter-day pastiche: On a Newly Arisen Apocalyptic Tone
in Philosophy (1980). The historical notes appended to these pieces are
the best (indeed only) source of information in English for the details of
this curious dispute.
† For example, that Kant’s principle of “universalizing the maxim” of an action meant that
anyone of lustful or homicidal tendencies would thereby be authorized to fornicate or
murder as he pleased (cf. 8: 421).
428On a recently prominent tone of
superiority in philosophy
Once it had lost its first meaning, as a scientific wisdom of life, the name 8: 389
of philosophy very soon came into demand as a decorative title for the
understanding possessed by uncommon thinkers, for whom it now represented a sort of unveiling of a mystery. To the ascetics in the Makarian
desert,1 their monkishness was said to be philosophy. The alchemist called
himself philosophus per ignem.a The lodges of old and later times are adepts
of a mystery handed down to them, of which they jealously refuse to tell
us anything ( philosophus per initiationem). And finally, the most recent
possessors of it are those who have it within them, but are unfortunately
incapable of uttering and disseminating it generally, by means of language ( philosophus per inspirationem). Now if there were a knowledge of
the super-sensible (alone a true mystery, from the theoretical viewpoint),
which the human mind can nevertheless unravel from a practical point
of view, it would still, as a power of knowledge through concepts, be far
inferior to that which, as a power of intuition, might be perceived directly
through the understanding. For by means of the former the discursive
understanding must employ much labor on resolving and again compounding its concepts according to principles, and toil up many steps
to make advances in knowledge, whereas an intellectual intuition would
grasp and present the object immediately, and all at once. So whoever
may consider himself to be in possession of the latter will look down on
the former with disdain; and conversely, the comfort of such a use of
reason is a strong inducement to the bold postulation of such a power
of intuition, and likewise to the high commendation of a philosophy
founded upon it. The same can also be readily explained by the naturally
self-seeking tendency in man, which reason tacitly indulges.
For it is due not only to natural indolence, but also to the vanity of 8: 390
man (as to a misunderstood freedom), that those who have enough to
live on, whether in affluence or penury, consider themselves superior in
comparison with those who must work in order to live. The Arab or
Mongolian despises the townsman, and thinks himself superior by comparison, because wandering about in the desert with his horses and sheep
is more pastime than work. The forest Tungus intends to hurl a curse at
his brother’s head when he says: “May you raise your cattle yourself, as
the Burat 2 does!” The latter passes on the compliment, and says: “May
you till the soil, as the Russian does!” The latter will likely say, according to his own way of thinking: “May you sit at the weaving-stool, like
a German!” All, in a word, consider themselves superior to the extent
that they believe they do not have to work. And in accordance with this
principle, things have lately gone so far that an alleged philosophy is
openly proclaimed to the public, in which one does not have to work,
but need only hearken and attend to the oracle within, in order to gain
a philosopher by fire
431
complete possession of all the wisdom to which philosophy aspires. And
this, moreover, in a tone which shows that the proponents of this philosophy are not at all inclined to align themselves with those who – like schoolmen – consider themselves obliged to proceed slowly and circumspectly
from the critique of their cognitive powers to dogmatic knowledge, but
are able, rather – like men of genius – to accomplish by a single piercing
glance within them everything that industry can ever hope to achieve,
and a good deal more besides. In sciences that require work, such as
mathematics, natural science, ancient history, linguistics, etc., and even in
philosophy, so far as it is obliged to confine itself to a methodical development and systematic arranging of concepts, many a person can certainly
perform with pride, in the pedantic style; but to none save the philosopher of intuition, who makes his demonstration, not by the Herculean
labor of self-knowledge from below upwards, but soaring above this, by
an apotheosis (which costs him nothing) from above downwards, can it
be given to perform with superiority; since he is there speaking from his
own observation, and is not obliged to be answerable to anyone else.
And now to the matter in hand!
Plato, no less a mathematician than he was a philosopher, admired among
8: 391
the properties of certain geometrical figures, e.g., the circle, a sort of
purposiveness, i.e., fitness to resolve a multiplicity of problems, or multiplicity in resolving one and the same problem (as in the theory of
geometrical loci), from a principle, just as if the requirements for constructing certain quantitative concepts were laid down in them on purpose,
although they can be grasped and demonstrated as necessary a priori. But
purposiveness is thinkable only through relation of the object to an understanding, as its cause.
But now since with our understanding, as a faculty of cognition through
concepts, we are unable to extend our a priori knowledge beyond our
concept (though this does actually happen in mathematics), Plato was
obliged to assume that we men possess intuitions a priori, which would,
however, have their first origin, not in our understanding (for the latter is
not a faculty of intuition, but only a discursive or thinking faculty), but
rather in one that was simultaneously the ultimate ground of all things,
i.e., the divine understanding, whose intuitions direct would then deserve
to be called archetypes (Ideas).
But our intuiting of these divine Ideas (for we should still have to
have an intuition a priori, if we wished to make intelligible to ourselves
the capacity for synthetic a priori propositions in pure mathematics),
would to us have been given only indirectly, at our birth, as an intuiting
of copies (ectypa), as it were shadow-images of all things, which we know
synthetically a priori; though that birth has simultaneously brought with
it a darkening of these Ideas, through forgetfulness of their origin, as a
432
consequence of the fact that our mind (now called soul) has been thrust
into a body, from whose fetters it would now have to be the noble task
of philosophy to release us.*
But nor must we forget Pythagoras, of whom, indeed, we now know 8: 392
too little to make out anything certain about the metaphysical principle
of his philosophy. As with Plato the wonders of shapes (in geometry),
so with Pythagoras the wonders of numbers (in arithmetic), i.e., the appearance of a certain purposiveness, and a fitness seemingly imparted
deliberately into their constitution for the solution of many rational
tasks of mathematics, where intuition a priori (space and time), and not
merely a discursive thinking, must be presupposed, awoke his attention
as if to a sort of magic, simply in order to make intelligible the possibility, not only of the enlargement of our concepts of quantity as such,
but also of their special and seemingly mysterious properties. History
records that discovery of the numerical relation among the tones, and
of the law by which they alone produce a music, led him to the idea
that since, in this play of sensations, mathematics (as a science of numbers) contains the principle of its form as well (and even, it appears, a
priori, in virtue of its necessity), we are therefore imbued with the admittedly only dim intuition of a nature which has been ordered according
to numerical equations by an understanding that rules over it; which
idea, when applied to the heavenly bodies, also brought forth the doctrine of the harmony of the spheres. Now nothing is more animating
to the senses than music; but the animating principle in man is the soul;
and since music, according to Pythagoras, rests entirely on perceived
* In all these inferences, Plato at least proceeds consistently. Before him there undoubtedly hovered, albeit obscurely, the question that has only lately achieved
clear expression: “How are synthetic propositions possible a priori?” Could
he have guessed at that time, what has only been discovered since, that there
are indeed intuitions a priori, but not of the human understanding, since (under the name of space and time) they are actually sensuous; that all objects of
sense are therefore perceived by us merely as appearances, and that even their
forms, which we are able to determine a priori in mathematics, are not those of
things-in-themselves, but only (subjective) forms of our sensibility, which are
therefore valid for all objects of possible experience, but not a step beyond that;
he would not then have looked for pure intuition (which he needed, to make
synthetic a priori knowledge intelligible to himself) in the divine understanding
and its archetypes of all things, as independent objects; or thereby have put the
torch to enthusiasm. For this he certainly perceived, that if, in the intuition
that underlies geometry, he wished to claim that he could intuit empirically the
object in itself, then the geometrical judgment and the whole of mathematics would be a merely empirical science, which contradicts the necessity which
(besides intuitability) is precisely what assures to mathematics so high a rank
among all the sciences.

numerical relationships, and since (as we need to mark well) this animating principle in man, the soul, is at the same time a free, self-determining
8: 393 entity, his definition of it: anima est numerus se ipsum movens a can perhaps
be made intelligible, and to some extent justified, if it be assumed that
by this power of self-movement he wished to point out its difference
from matter, as the intrinsically lifeless that is movable only through
something external, and thus to allude to freedom.
Hence it was mathematics upon which both Pythagoras and Plato
were philosophizing, when they assigned all a priori knowledge (whether it
might contain intuition or concept) to the intellectual sphere, and by this
philosophy fancied they had stumbled upon a mystery, where no mystery
exists: not because reason can answer all the questions submitted to it,
but because its oracle falls silent, once the question has been elevated
so high that it now no longer has any meaning. If, for example, geometry proposes some already named properties of the circle (as may be
found in Montucla),3 and the question is now asked: whence does it possess these properties, which seem to contain a sort of extended utility and
purposiveness? – no other answer can be given to this but: Quaerit delirus,
quod non respondet Homerus.b Anyone who wishes to solve a mathematical
problem philosophically, thereby contradicts himself; for example, why
is it that the ratio of the three sides of a right-angled triangle can only be
that of the numbers 3, 4, and 5?4 But he who philosophizes upon a mathematical problem believes that here he has stumbled upon a mystery, and
for that reason is seeing something transcendently great, where he is not
seeing anything, and finds, in the very fact that he is brooding inwardly
upon an idea, which he can neither make intelligible to himself, nor
communicate to others, the true philosophy ( philosophia arcani),c where
the poetic talent then finds food for itself in feeling, and the pleasures
of speculation: which is certainly far more inviting and splendid than
the law of reason, to earn oneself a possession by work; but in which
both poverty and arrogance create the ridiculous appearance of hearing
philosophy speak in a superior tone.
The philosophy of Aristotle, on the other hand, is work. But (like
the two preceding) I consider him here only as a metaphysician, that
is, a dismemberer of all knowledge a priori into its elements, only, as a
craftsman of reason, to put it all together again out of those elements
(the categories); whose treatment, so far as it goes, has retained its utility,
albeit that in progressing it failed to extend those principles which he ranks
as sensuous (without his noticing the dangerous leap that he had to make
here), to the super-sensible as well, whither his categories were unable

to carry him: at which point it was necessary beforehand to analyze and 8: 394
measure the organ of thinking in itself, namely reason, according to the
two fields thereof, the theoretical and the practical; though this labor
was reserved for a later age.
But now let us listen to and evaluate the new tone in philosophizing
(whereby philosophy may be dispensed with).
That superior persons philosophize, should it even be up to the peaks of
metaphysics, must be regarded as greatly to their credit, and they deserve
indulgence in their (scarcely avoidable) clash with the school, since they
do, after all, condescend to the latter on a footing of civil equality.*
But that would-be philosophers behave in a superior fashion can by no
means be indulged in them, since they elevate themselves above their
guild-brothers, and violate the inalienable right of the latter to freedom
and equality in matters of mere reason.
The principle of wishing to philosophize by influence of a higher 8: 395
feeling is the most suitable of all for the tone of superiority; for who will
dispute my feeling with me? And if I can now but make it credible that this
feeling is not merely subjective in myself, but can be demanded of anyone,
and thus also ranks as objective, and a piece of knowledge, not merely
in being excogitated as a concept, but as an intuition (apprehension of
the object itself ): then I have a great advantage over all who must first
* There is, however, a difference between philosophizing and making philosophers. The latter happens in the tone of superiority, if despotism over the reason
of the people (and even over one’s own reason), by fettering it to a blind belief,
is given out as philosophy. To this, for example, belongs “belief in the thunderlegion in the days of Marcus Aurelius,”5 likewise “in the fire that miraculously
broke out under the ruins of Jerusalem, to hinder Julian the Apostate”;6 which
was given out as the genuinely true philosophy, and the opposite of it called
“colliers’ unbelief” (just as if the charcoal-burners, deep in their woods, were
renowned for being very incredulous in regard to the tales that were brought
to them): to which may be added the assurance that philosophy has already
come to an end two thousand years ago, because “the Stagirite7 has conquered
so much for science, that he has left little of importance any more for his successors to spy out.” Thus the levelers of the political order are not only those
who desire, with Rousseau, that the citizenry should be collectively equal to
one another, because any one is all; there are also those who wish all to be equal
to one another, because but for One they would collectively be nothing, and
are monarchists out of necessity: elevating now Plato, and now Aristotle to the
throne, so that, being conscious of their own incapacity for personal thought,
they do not have to endure the hateful comparison with others still living. And
thus (principally by the latter judgment) the superior person creates philosophers, in that by obscuration he puts an end to any further philosophizing. The
phenomenon cannot be better represented in its proper light than by the fable
of Voss (Berliner Monatsschrift, November 1795, last page), a tale that is worth
a hecatomb,8 all by itself.
435
resort to justification in order to plume themselves on the truth of their
claims. I can therefore speak in the tone of a commander, who is exempt
from the onus of proving his title to possession (beati possidentes).aSo
long live the philosophy of feeling, which leads us directly to the heart
of the matter! Away with ratiocination from concepts, which attempts
the task only by the roundabout method of general attributes, and which,
before it yet has a matter which it can grasp immediately, first demands
specific forms to which it may subject this matter! And given also that
reason can offer no further explanation whatever about the legitimacy
of the outcome of these its high insights, there remains nevertheless a
fact: “Philosophy has its secrets that can be felt.”*
* A celebrated possessor thereof expresses himself thus on the subject: “As long
as reason, qua law-giver of willing, must say to the phenomena (which here,
of course, are the free actions of men): you please me – you please me not, for so
long must it regard the phenomena as effects of realities”; from which he then
concludes that the law-giving of reason has need, not merely of a form, but of
a matter (material purpose) as determining ground of willing, i.e., a feeling of
pleasure (or displeasure) at an object must precede, if reason is to be practical.
This error, which, if it is allowed to creep in, would destroy all morality and
leave nothing behind but the maxim of happiness, which can have no objective
principle whatever (since it varies with difference in the subject) – this error, I
say, can be confidently brought to light only through the following touchstone
of feeling. That pleasure (or displeasure) which must necessarily precede the law,
if the act is to take place, is pathological; but that which the law must necessarily
precede, for this to happen, is moral. The former is based on empirical principles
(the matter of choice); the latter on a pure principle a priori (in which the only
concern is with the form of determination of the will). With this it is likewise
easy to discover the fallacy ( fallacia causae non causae),b when the eudaemonist
announces that the pleasure (satisfaction) that a righteous man has in view, in
order to feel it one day in the consciousness of his well-conducted course of
life (and thus the prospect of his future felicity), is in fact the true motive for
conducting his affairs well (in accordance with the law). For since I must assume him beforehand to be righteous and obedient to the law, i.e., to be one
in whom the law precedes the pleasure, in order for him subsequently to feel a
pleasure of the soul in the consciousness of his well-conducted course of life, it
is an empty circle in the reasoning to make the pleasure, which is a consequence,
into the cause of that course of life.
Yet as for the plain syncretism of certain moralists, whereby though not
wholly, yet in part, they make eudaemonia into the objective principle of morality
(it being granted that it also has, unawares, a concurrent subjective influence
on determining the human will in accordance with duty), that is the direct way,
of course, to having no principle at all. For the mixed motives borrowed from
a happy the possessors
b fallacy of ‘false cause’
436
With this alleged feelability of an object, which can nevertheless be 8: 396
met with only in pure reason, the situation is now as follows. Hitherto we
had heard only of three stages of apprehension, down to its disappearance in total ignorance: knowledge, belief, and opinion.*
felicity, even if they tend to exactly the same actions as those that flow from pure
moral laws, still contaminate and weaken at the same time the moral disposition
itself, whose value and high rank consist precisely in this, that regardless of
these motives, and prevailing, even, over all their solicitations, it demonstrates
obedience to nothing else but the law.
* The central term is also used, on occasion, in the theoretical sense, as a synonym for holding something to be probable; and here it must indeed be noted,
that of that which lies beyond all bounds of possible experience, we can say
neither that it is probable, nor that it is improbable, so that in regard to such
an object, even the word ‘belief’ does not occur at all in a theoretical sense.
By the statement that this or that is probable, we understand an intermediate
(in apprehension) between opining and knowing; and here it turns out as with
all other intermediates, namely that we can make of them what we want. But
if somebody says, for example: It is at least probable that the soul lives on after
death, he does not know what he is wanting. For we call probable that which,
when apprehended, has more than half the certainty (the sufficient reason)
on its side. The reasons must therefore collectively contain a partial cognition, a part of the knowledge of the object on which we are passing judgment.
Now if the object is in no way the object of a knowledge possible to us (such
as is the nature of the soul, qua living substance, in the absence of any connection with a body, i.e., as a spirit), then about its possibility we can judge
neither the probability nor the improbability, since we cannot judge at all.
For the alleged grounds of knowledge are in a series which comes nowhere
near to the sufficient reason, and thus to knowledge itself, since they relate
to something super-sensible of which, as such, no theoretical knowledge is
possible.
The position is just the same with belief in the witness of another, that
allegedly has reference to something super-sensible. The authenticity of a report is always an empirical matter; and the person in whose testimony I am to
believe must be the object of an experience. But if he is taken to be a supersensible being, then I can be taught by no experience (since that would be
self-contradictory), as to his very existence, nor as to the fact that it is such
a being who testifies this to me; nor can I even infer this from the subjective
impossibility of being able to explain to myself the appearance of an inner
summons vouchsafed to me, as due to anything else but supernatural influence
(in view of what has just been said of the judgment according to probability).
Hence there is no theoretical belief in the super-sensible.
In a practical (morally-practical) sense, however, a belief in the supersensible is not only possible, but is actually inseparably bound up with that
point of view. For the sum of morality in myself, although super-sensible, and
thus not empirical, is nevertheless given with unmistakable truth and authority
437
Now a new one is introduced, which has nothing whatever in common
8: 397 with logic, and is to be no advance of the understanding, but rather a
premonition ( praevisio sensitiva) of that which is not an object of the
senses at all, viz., an intimation of the super-sensible.
8: 398 Now here we self-evidently encounter a certain mystical touch, an
overleap (salto mortale)9 from concepts to the unthinkable, a power
of seizing upon that which no concept attains to, an expectation of
mysteries, or rather a dangling of them before us, which is actually a
turning of heads towards enthusiasm. For intimation is obscure expectation, and contains the hope of a solution, though in matters of reason this
is possible only through concepts; if these are transcendent, therefore,
and can lead to no true knowledge of the object, they must necessarily
promise a surrogate thereof, supernatural information (mystical illumination): which is then the death of all philosophy.
Plato the academic, therefore, though through no fault of his own (for he
used his intellectual intuitions only backwards, to explain the possibility
of a synthetic knowledge a priori, not forwards, to extend it through those
Ideas that were legible in the divine understanding), became the father
of all enthusiasm by way of philosophy. But I would not wish to confuse him
with Plato the letter-writer (lately translated into German).10 The latter,
to “the four things pertaining to knowledge, the name of the object,
the description, the presentation and the science” would add “yet a fifth”
(wheel to the coach);11 “namely the very object itself and its true being.”
(through a categorical imperative), albeit that the latter prescribes a purpose
(the highest good), which, theoretically regarded, cannot be achieved through
my powers alone, without the contributory might of a world-governor. But
to believe in this, from a moral and practical viewpoint, does not mean to apprehend its reality beforehand in a theoretical sense, so that to understand
this prescribed purpose one would obtain enlightenment, and to effect it, motives; for the law of reason is already in itself objectively adequate to this. It
means, rather, to act according to the ideal of this purpose, as though such a
world-government were real. For this imperative (which prescribes, not belief, but action), contains, on the side of man, obedience and subjection of
his [arbitrary] choice under the law; but at the same time, on the side of the
will that prescribes a purpose to him, a capacity (which is not the human one)
adapted to that purpose, on whose behalf the reason of man can indeed prescribe actions, but not their outcome (the fulfilment of the purpose), since
that is not always or wholly within human power. So in the categorical imperative of the materially practical reason, which tells man: I will that your
actions be concordant with the final purpose of all things, there is therefore already simultaneously thought the presupposition of a law-giving will,
which contains all power (of the divine), and has no need of being specially
imposed.
438
“This unalterable essence, which can be intuited only in and through
the soul, but as if by a leaping spark of fire, spontaneously kindles a
light therein,” he claims (as an exalted philosopher) “to have grasped;
though it cannot be spoken of, to the people at least, since one would at
once become convinced of one’s ignorance; for every attempt of this kind
would already be dangerous, partly because these high truths might be
exposed to a coarse contempt, partly” (which is the only sensible point
to be made here) “because the soul might become prey to empty hopes
and the vain delusion of knowing greatsecrets.”
Who can fail to see here the mystagogue, who not only raves on his
own behalf, but is simultaneously the founder of a club, and in speaking
to his adepts, rather than to the people (meaning all the uninitiated),
plays the superior with his alleged philosophy! I take leave to adduce
some more recent examples of the same thing. 8: 399
In the latest mystico-Platonic idiom we are told:12 “All human philosophy can show only the dawn: the sun must be divined.” But nobody,
after all, can divine a sun, if he has not otherwise already seen one; for it
might well be that on our globe day regularly followed night (as in the
Mosaic account of creation), without anyone ever getting to see a sun,
owing to the constantly overcast sky, and yet that all affairs would equally
take their appropriate course according to this alternation (of day and
season). Yet in such a state of things a true philosopher would not indeed
divine a sun (for that is not his business), but could still perhaps guess
at it, in order, by assuming the hypothesis of such a heavenly body, to
explain that phenomenon; and might also in that way hit upon the truth.
To look into the sun (the super-sensible) without being blinded is not
possible; but to see it adequately in reflection (of the reason that morally
enlightens the soul), and even from a practical viewpoint, as the older
Plato did, is perfectly feasible. By contrast, the new Platonists “certainly
give us only a stage sun,” because they wish to deceive us by feelings
(intimations), i.e., merely the subjective, which gives us no concept of
the object, in order to buoy us up with the delusion of a knowledge
of the objective, which borders on extravagance. Now the platonizing
philosopher of feeling is inexhaustible in such pictorial utterances, which
are supposed to make this divination intelligible; e.g., “to approach the
goddess of wisdom so closely that one may hear the rustle of her robes”;
and likewise in belauding the art of the pseudo–Plato, who “though unable to lift the veil of Isis,13 can yet make it so thin that one may divine
the goddess beneath it.” How thin, we are not told; but presumably it is
still thick enough for us to make what we please of the apparition, for
otherwise it would be a seeing, which is certainly to be avoided.
To the very same end, in the absence of precise proofs, we are now
offered by way of arguments, “analogies, probabilities” (already just
439
8: 400 alluded to) “and the danger of emasculating a reason become so highstrung through metaphysical*sublimation, that it will hardly be able to
hold its own in the struggle against evil”; albeit that in these very principles a priori the practical reason correctly feels a strength that was
* What the new Platonist has said so far is, as to the treatment of his theme, pure
metaphysics, and can therefore refer only to the formal principles of reason. But
it also covertly interpolates a hyperphysics, i.e., not just principles of practical
reason, but a theory of the nature of the super-sensible (of God and the human
mind), and purports to know this in “not so very fine-spun” a fashion. But the
absolute nullity of a philosophy, which here relates to the matter (the object)
of pure rational concepts, if it has not (as in transcendental theology) been
carefully detached from all empirical ties, may be illustrated by the following
example.
The transcendental concept of God, as the ens realissimum,a cannot be circumvented in philosophy, however abstract such a concept may be; for it pertains to the union, and at the same time the elucidation, of everything concrete
that may subsequently enter into applied theology and theory of religion. The
question now arises: am I to think of God as the sum total (complexus, aggregatum) of all realities, or as the supreme ground of them? If I do the first, I must
produce examples of this material from which I put together the highest being,
so that the concept thereof should not be altogether empty and without meaning. I shall therefore attribute to him understanding, or even a will and so on,
as realities. But now all the understanding that I know of is a capacity to think,
i.e., a discursive power of presentation, or one that is possible through a feature common to a number of things (from whose differences I must therefore
abstract in thought), and is thus impossible without a limitation of the subject.
Hence a divine understanding cannot be taken for a power to think. But of any
other understanding, which might, say, be a faculty of intuition, I have not the
slightest conception; hence the concept of an understanding which I posit in
the supreme being is totally devoid of meaning. Again, if I posit in him another
reality, a will, through which he is the cause of all things outside himself, I must
presume one in which his satisfaction (acquiescentia) in no way depends on the
existence of things outside him: for that would be limitation (negatio). Now
again I have not the slightest notion, nor can I give any example, of a will in
which the subject would not base his satisfaction on the success of his willing, and
which would thus not depend upon the existence of the outside object. Thus,
as in the previous case, the concept of a will in the supreme being, as a reality
inherent to him, is either an empty one, or (what is even worse), an anthropomorphic concept, which if – as is unavoidable – it is extended into the practical,
corrupts all religion and transforms it into idolatry. But if I frame to myself the
concept of the ens realissimum as the ground of all reality, I am saying that God is
the being who contains the ground of everything in the world for which we men
have need to suppose an understanding (e.g., everything purposive therein); he is
the being from whom the existence of all worldly being originates, not out of the
a most real being
440
otherwise never guessed at, and is actually emasculated and lamed far
more by the substitution of empirical elements (which precisely for that
reason are unsuitable for giving universal laws). 8: 401
The summons of the latest German wisdom, to philosophize through
feeling (and not, like that of a few years ago, to employ philosophy to put
the moral feeling into force and motion), is ultimately exposed to a test
at which it is necessarily bound to fail. Its challenge runs: “The surest
mark of authenticity in human philosophy is not that it should make us
more certain, but that it should make us better.” Of this test it cannot 8: 402
be demanded that the betterment of man (effected by the feeling of
mystery) should be certified by an assay-master of his morality, trying
necessity of his nature ( per emanationem), but according to a circumstance for
which we men are obliged to suppose a free will, in order to make the possibility
thereof intelligible to us. Now here what the nature of the supreme being may
be (objectively) can be posited as wholly inscrutable to us, and quite beyond the
sphere of any theoretical knowledge possible to us, and yet reality still be (subjectively) left to these concepts in a practical respect (with regard to the course of
life); in relation to which, also, an analogy of the divine understanding and will
to that of man and his practical reason can alone be assumed, notwithstanding that in a theoretical sense there is absolutely no analogy between them.
From the moral law which our own reason authoritatively prescribes to us,
and not from any theory of the nature of things-in-themselves, there now proceeds the concept of God which practical pure reason constrains us to make for
ourselves.
If, therefore, it is said by one of those men of might, who have lately been
proclaiming with ardor a wisdom that costs them no trouble, since they profess to have caught this goddess by the hem of her garment and seized hold of
her, that “he despises anyone who thinks to make his own God,” this is but one
of the singularities of that tribe whose tone (as especially favored persons) is
superior. For in itself it is evident that a concept which has to proceed from our
reason will have to be made by ourselves. Had we sought to take it from any
appearance (any object of experience), the ground of our knowledge would be
empirical, and unable to yield validity for everybody, or the apodictic practical
certainty which a universally binding law must possess. We should be compelled, rather, to first hold a wisdom that appeared to us in personal form up
against that self-made concept of ours, as the archetype, in order to see whether
this person also corresponded to the character of that self-made archetype; and
even supposing that we encounter nothing therein that contradicts it, it is still
utterly impossible to know of its appropriateness to such an archetype except
by super-sensory experience (since the object is super-sensible): which is a selfcontradiction. Thus theophany creates from the Platonic Idea an idol, which
cannot be revered in anything but a superstitious fashion: whereas theology,
proceeding from concepts of our own reason, sets up an ideal that compels our
worship, since it has itself arisen from the holiest duties, which are independent
of theology.
441
it in a cupel; anyone, to be sure, can easily weigh the coinage of good
actions, but as to how much sterling metal they contain at heart, who can
offer a publicly valid testimony to this? And yet such it would have to be,
if it is thereby to be demonstrated that this feeling, as such, makes better
men, whereas scientific theory is unfruitful and ineffective in this respect.
No experience, therefore, can provide the touchstone for this; it must
be sought solely in practical reason, as given a priori. Inner experience
and feeling (which in itself is empirical and thus contingent) are aroused
only by the voice of reason (dictamen rationis), which speaks clearly to
everyone and is capable of being scientifically known; but not a particular
practical rule for reason, introduced, say, by feeling, which is impossible;
for in that case it could never be universally valid. We must therefore
be able to perceive a priori which principle might make better men,
and will do so, if only it is brought clearly and unceasingly to their
souls, and they pay heed to the powerful impression that it makes upon
them.
Now every man finds in his reason the idea of duty, and trembles on
hearing its brazen voice, when inclinations arise in him, which tempt
him to disobedience towards it. He is persuaded that, even though the
latter all collectively conspire against it, the majesty of the law, which his
own reason prescribes to him, must yet unhesitatingly outweigh them
all, and that his will is therefore also capable of this. All this can and
must be presented to man, clearly if not scientifically, if he is to be made
aware both of the authority of his reason, which commands him, and
also of its actual commandments; and is to that extent theory. Now I
put it to man, as he puts it to himself: What is it in me which brings it
about that I can sacrifice the innermost allurements of my instincts, and
all wishes that proceed from my nature, to a law which promises me no
compensating advantage, and threatens no loss on its violation; a law,
indeed, which I respect the more intimately, the more strictly it ordains,
and the less it offers for doing so? By astonishment at the magnitude
and sublimity of the inward disposition in mankind, and at the same
8: 403 time the impenetrability of the mystery that veils it (for the answer, it
is freedom, would be tautological, since that is precisely what constitutes
the mystery), this question arouses the whole soul. We can never weary
of giving attention to it, and admiring in itself a power that yields to no
power in Nature; and this admiration is simply the feeling produced by
Ideas, and if, besides the teaching of morality in school and pulpit, the
presentation of this mystery were made a special and oft-repeated topic
of instruction, this feeling would penetrate deep into the soul, nor would
it fail to make men morally better.
Here, then, is that which Archimedes had need of, but did not find: a
fixed point to which reason can apply its lever, in order by its principle to
move the human will, even when the whole of Nature resists it; and this
442
without resting it either upon the present or a future world, but merely
upon its inner Idea of freedom, which lies there as a sure foundation
through the unshakable moral law. This, then, is the secret which can
become possible to feel only after slow development of the concepts of the
understanding, and of carefully tested principles and thus only through
work. It is given, not empirically (proposed to reason for solution), but a
priori (as real insight within the bounds of our reason), and even extends
the knowledge of reason up to the super-sensible, but only in a practical
respect: not, say, by a feeling, which purports to be the basis of knowledge
(the mystical), but by a clear cognition which acts upon feeling (the moral).
The tone of one who considers himself possessed of this true secret
cannot be superior: for only dogmatic or historical cognition is puffed
up. The cognition of the former, chastened by critique of his own reason,
inevitably obliges him to moderation in his claims (unpretentiousness);
but the arrogance of the latter cognition, the erudition in Plato and the
classics which pertains only to the cultivation of taste, cannot justify the
wish to play the philosopher with it.
To censure such a claim did not strike me as superfluous at the present
time, when adornment with the title of philosophy has become a matter
of fashion, and the philosopher of vision (if we allow such a person)
might – seeing how easy it is, by an audacious stroke, to attain without
trouble to the summit of insight – be able unawares (since audacity is 8: 404
catching) to assemble a large following about him: which the police in
the kingdom of the sciences cannot permit.
The dismissive habit of crying down the formal in our knowledge
(which is yet the preeminent business of philosophy) as a pedantry, under
the name of “a pattern-factory,” confirms this suspicion, namely that
there is a secret intention, under the guise of philosophy to actually
outlaw all philosophy, and as victor to play the superior over it ( pedibus
subjecta vicissim obteritur, nos exaequat victoria coelo – Lucretius).a But how
little this attempt can succeed, under the illumination of an ever-vigilant
critique, may be seen from the following example.
In form resides the essence of the matter ( forma dat esse rei, as the
schoolmen said), so far as this is to be known by reason. If this matter be an object of the senses, then it is the form of things in intuition
(as appearances), and even pure mathematics is nothing else but a formtheory of pure intuition; just as metaphysics, qua pure philosophy, founds
its knowledge at the highest level on forms of thought, under which every
object (matter of knowledge) may thereafter be subsumed. Upon these
forms depends the possibility of all synthetic knowledge a priori, which
we cannot, of course, deny that we possess. But the transition to the
super-sensible, to which reason irresistibly drives us, and which it can
a With it trampled underfoot in turn, victory exalts us to the skies[De rerum natura 1: 78–9].
443
accomplish only in a moral and practical respect, it can also effect solely
through those (practical) laws which make as their principle, not the
matter of free actions (their purpose), but only their form, the appropriateness of their maxims to the universality of a legislation as such. In
both fields (theoretical and practical) it is not an arbitrary form-giving
undertaken by design, or even machine-made (on behalf of the state), but
above all a piece of handwork, dealing with the given object, and indeed
with no thought of taking up and evaluating the preceding industrious
and careful work of the subject, his own faculty (of reason); by contrast,
the gentleman who opens up an oracle for the vision of the super-sensible
will be unable to deny having contrived it by a mechanical manipulation
of men’s brains, and attached the name of philosophy to it for honorific
purposes alone.
8: 405 But now why all this quarrelling between two parties, who at bottom have one and the same good intention, namely to make men wise
and honest? It is much ado about nothing, disunion through misunderstanding, needing no reconciliation, but only explanation on either side,
in order to conclude a treaty which makes concord henceforth more
intimate than ever.
The veiled goddess, before whom we both bow the knee, is the moral
law within us in its inviolable majesty. We hearken to her voice, indeed,
and also understand her command well enough; but on listening are in
doubt whether it comes from man himself, out of the absolute authority
of his own reason, or whether it proceeds from another being, whose
nature is unknown to him, and which speaks to man through this his
own reason. At bottom we should perhaps do better to desist from this
inquiry altogether, since it is merely speculative, and since what we are
(objectively) obliged to do remains always the same, whether we base it
on the one principle or the other; were it not that the didactic method, of
bringing the moral law within us to clear concepts by logical instruction,
is in truth the only philosophical method, whereas that of personifying
this law and making out of morally commanding reason a veiled Isis
(though we attribute to her no other properties than can be found by
that method), is an aesthetic way of presenting exactly the same object; of
which one can indeed subsequently make use, once the principles have
been clarified by the first method, in order to vivify those ideas by sensory,
albeit merely analogical presentation – though always with some danger
of lapsing into visionary enthusiasm, which is the death of all philosophy.
To be able to discern this goddess would thus be to say no more than
that one is guided by moral feeling to concepts of duty, before having yet
been able to make clear to oneself the principles on which this feeling
depends; which discernment of a law, as soon as it emerges into clear
insight by logical treatment, is the true business of philosophy, without

which that pronouncement of reason would be the voice of an oracle,*
exposed to every kind of interpretation.
At any rate, without taking this proposal into comparison, “if,” as 8: 406
Fontenelle said on another occasion, “Monsieur N. is still quite determined to believe in the oracle, nobody can prevent him.”14
* This mystery-mongering is of a quite peculiar sort. Its adepts make no secret
of the fact that they have kindled their light from Plato; and this alleged Plato
freely confesses that if asked what it is, then (which is thereby illuminated), he
is not able to say. But all the better! For then it is self-evident that he, another
Prometheus, has snatched the spark for it directly from heaven. So well may
one talk in the superior tone, if one is of the old nobility, and can say: “In these
advanced times of ours it will soon be the custom for everything that is said or
done from feeling to be considered enthusiasm. Poor Plato, if you did not have
the seal of antiquity upon you, and if one could make any claim to scholarship
without having read you, who would still want to read you in this prosaic age,
in which the highest wisdom is to see nothing but what lies at one’s feet, and to
accept nothing but what can be grasped with hands?” – But this conclusion is
unfortunately not justly drawn; it proves too much. For Aristotle, an exceedingly
prosaic philosopher, still certainly has the seal of antiquity upon him too, and by
that principle, a claim to be read! At bottom, indeed, all philosophy is prosaic;
and a proposal to now begin philosophizing poetically again might well be
received as one would a suggestion that the merchant should henceforth write
his catalogues, not in prose, but in verse.
